Adieu, inflatable t. rex

scott comments first:

he will say: headline could be funnier
antiquated of language of adieu and old-timey enligsh writing
he wans't sure of its relevance of it and why itw as needed
he sees it served to heighten the contrast
to make this silly inflatable t-rex seem more imprtant by punding up the language in that way
but normally for taht you want some clearly motivating force for the language #takeaway 

we get into headline that we're saying goodbye to him, we don't get a hue joke or laugh, but we know what it's about (that's importnat), but you want it to be funny #takeaway 

2: it's a little long for what it is
the escalation does a decent job of stating at square one, he helped handout halloween candy
then we brought him to sporting events
political protests
then he finally tried to thwart a bank robbery
pretty good escalation, but not seeing the concept being a high-concept you would wnat to write an article about #takeaway 

we're writing an article a day
they're not all going ot be gems, we wnat to writ them if we think they'll be goodenough adn they inspire us tow rite them 

once we have written, we go through and select those to put in our submission pile and here we have a harsher critique #process #takeaway 

3: when he got to midpoint he knew what was happening, where it was going, wanted to see it escalate more
for him, what that would have
