## Adieu, inflatable t. rex
[note: i need to find full copy?]

scott comments first:

he will say: headline could be funnier
antiquated of language of adieu and old-timey enligsh writing
he wans't sure of its relevance of it and why itw as needed
he sees it served to heighten the contrast
to make this silly inflatable t-rex seem more imprtant by punding up the language in that way
but normally for taht you want some clearly motivating force for the language #takeaway 

we get into headline that we're saying goodbye to him, we don't get a hue joke or laugh, but we know what it's about (that's importnat), but you want it to be funny #takeaway 

2: it's a little long for what it is
the escalation does a decent job of stating at square one, he helped handout halloween candy
then we brought him to sporting events
political protests
then he finally tried to thwart a bank robbery
pretty good escalation, but not seeing the concept being a high-concept you would wnat to write an article about #takeaway 

we're writing an article a day
they're not all going ot be gems, we wnat to writ them if we think they'll be goodenough adn they inspire us tow rite them 

once we have written, we go through and select those to put in our submission pile and here we have a harsher critique #process #takeaway 

3: when he got to midpoint he knew what was happening, where it was going, wanted to see it escalate more
for him, what that would have been is the relationship 
instead of showing up at the ballgme, let's have an affair with the t-rex
let's fall in love with the t-rex
let's see him detroy the family in some way
which is why we have to get rid of it

then we are moving into the absurd
the abusrd we get in here is he showed up to  bank robbery
it's suden, doesn't track with the rest; they were normal, not abusrd
took place in the real world, t-rex in your yard #takeaway 
the bank robbery itself doesn't fit in teh real world
and the t-rex being there is two impossible things #takeaway 
doesn't work the way it went

first advice: chalk it up experience, move on
if you did want to rewrite, try ot make it more abusrd (he's saying toss)
have to track as part of their family
work with coming up with a funnier headline
harder to do when you have already wrote the piece
it's like putting humpty dumpty back together #takeaway 

cathy: like dthe contrasting language
antiquated language added contrast but didn't htink it was motivated

tuitle suggestion: vaunted community member leads us
scott: yeah, it heightens it more if it's a commnunity saying more than a family

jack: main joke occurs in last paragraph but oculd have earlier
scott: very referenc based, slow to build

suggestiON: eulogy for inflatable t-rex
scott: yeah better

suggestion: allison, small kid in costume, concern he was shot?
scott: i got it was a blowup doll

critique: requires farir work to get what it's about 

scott: some off track jokes (twas gold idiots, and florida)
jokes nt along the same track. all jokes should be on the track
otherwise it seems like ulterior motive, differne tagenda and trakc of jokes

corey: it's based around a visual thing hta't described than seen; took time to see it in minds eye, required mental math

scott: funny madcap visual of t-rex, wans't epxlited or heightedn as much as it oculd have been

## Polterguest
Dan Linley

scott: nice and shorts likes the looks of it

scott: title polterguest is OK, communicates idea, but coudl be better
seen this beofre, it was on snl, the ghost who won't leave
his immediate reaction was: it's comedy, about a potlergiest, prob like something i've seen before

he read the piece, it's structured like dramatic piece, like it's cause and effect
legit way to structure a short prose piece (not short humor)
this is not comedic structure

it's cause and effect: first person puts on helmet, puts on helmt, we don't know hwat's going on

they enter the house, a lamp is thrown at their head and we know why the helmet is on (hook) and we don't know if the person with the helmet is any of these three people (pronoun mixup)

confusion begins here with the dialogue 

we have raspy get out voice of ghost, he gets that
now we know protag, the I, firs tperson, speaks next
the ghost speaks after and we assume it goes back and forth
and maybe the ghost is named william because he whispers acorss room

scott lost his place a good amount
dialogue with little atrtitubtion, you need to make sure it's clear who is talking #takeaway 
he does a pretty good job, just a couple poitns where he was lost

he got especially lost at "shes' going to leave you..."

we know ghost is trying to scare our protag whose name we don't know into thining his wife is leaving him

scott wasn't sure about it before; too late in the game to get that new info, we got hints, you aren't good enough, but couldnt' tell if this was needling, we didn't know it was the track #takeaway 
too suble to figure out, that coudl be more clear

now we know ghost is ineffectual and making shit up to scare hero

then he got confused by "my side of the bed" does hte ghost have a side of the bed?

scott says, if it's dialgoue heavy, hwy not write as a sketch? #takeaway 
you can have char attribution each line, no one gets confused

critque: better punchline, he agrees

critique: only two jokes, add more
scott: agreed. there's strucutre confusion, is it dramatic, beginning middle end, and cause effect, that's dif
we wnat story beats, rising tensio, reveresals 
but poast firs tparagraph we entered into comedic structure, ther'es one track, the ghost is trying to convince protag his wife doesn't like him #takeaway #major #process 
those are our beats and there aren't enough of them

however, the jokes escalate well
mortage and finances to bad spelling but not much further
and we could get more absurd and we didn't take advantage

scot: coming at a piece cold is great, you knwo nothing about it
you get headline, convinced into reading it or turned off by it
best way to review pieces is open cold and start reading and be as harsh as ar eader would be

cathy asks if the reader is a former lover (nice)

q: use misplaced focus, talk about it as an insurance case
they're putting a ghost on their insurance
that's a short piece idea
better for prose, letter to insurance company to convince them to cover polterguest damage
very clear humor concept, see how beats escalate
blood on wall was $400 to clean
existing IP, pepole get it, world of poltergiest 
one impossible thing, it's really simple

scott: simon rich did a piece called math problems
it's a math teacher who creates these math problems for students but wroks personal pborlems into them
so kids get inappropriately exopsed to drinking problems, marriage problems
that's funny, insightfl way to do satire, hide the reveal of personal problems within some other structure #takeaway 
coudl be problems of the writer
if you watn them as probs of the protag or char, that's fine too

q: can you use insults to indicate who is speaking?
scott: blunter solution is to use a sketch format
but if there is unique ways of speaking, you can use that, but be quick of it
