## Adieu, inflatable t. rex

scott comments first:

he will say: headline could be funnier
antiquated of language of adieu and old-timey enligsh writing
he wans't sure of its relevance of it and why itw as needed
he sees it served to heighten the contrast
to make this silly inflatable t-rex seem more imprtant by punding up the language in that way
but normally for taht you want some clearly motivating force for the language #takeaway 

we get into headline that we're saying goodbye to him, we don't get a hue joke or laugh, but we know what it's about (that's importnat), but you want it to be funny #takeaway 

2: it's a little long for what it is
the escalation does a decent job of stating at square one, he helped handout halloween candy
then we brought him to sporting events
political protests
then he finally tried to thwart a bank robbery
pretty good escalation, but not seeing the concept being a high-concept you would wnat to write an article about #takeaway 

we're writing an article a day
they're not all going ot be gems, we wnat to writ them if we think they'll be goodenough adn they inspire us tow rite them 

once we have written, we go through and select those to put in our submission pile and here we have a harsher critique #process #takeaway 

3: when he got to midpoint he knew what was happening, where it was going, wanted to see it escalate more
for him, what that would have been is the relationship 
instead of showing up at the ballgme, let's have an affair with the t-rex
let's fall in love with the t-rex
let's see him detroy the family in some way
which is why we have to get rid of it

then we are moving into the absurd
the abusrd we get in here is he showed up to  bank robbery
it's suden, doesn't track with the rest; they were normal, not abusrd
took place in the real world, t-rex in your yard #takeaway 
the bank robbery itself doesn't fit in teh real world
and the t-rex being there is two impossible things #takeaway 
doesn't work the way it went

first advice: chalk it up experience, move on
if you did want to rewrite, try ot make it more abusrd (he's saying toss)
have to track as part of their family
work with coming up with a funnier headline
harder to do when you have already wrote the piece
it's like putting humpty dumpty back together #takeaway 

cathy: like dthe contrasting language
antiquated language added contrast but didn't htink it was motivated

tuitle suggestion: vaunted community member leads us
scott: yeah, it heightens it more if it's a commnunity saying more than a family

jack: main joke occurs in last paragraph but oculd have earlier
scott: very referenc based, slow to build
