Funny in a FLASH 

## Overview
Scott is working on courses for niche areas in comedy/humor
prose is one – short fiction for new yorker
short pieces, a bunch, publish in collection

this is what the webinar is geared toward

“if you do comedy, you should make yorsuelf a generalist, and do comedy in every way you can”
if you write, perform
if you write sketches, perform sketches
write standup,do standup
juggle, cartooning, impressions” ***

thesis: 6 writing mistakes in shor thumor writing and how to fix them

scott dikkers is the sponsor but will spend alil in the middle talking about that

ABOUT HIM

was owner-editor of onion for 20-25 years
he’s mentored writers who have published in mcweeneys, new yorker, nyt bestselling collections!

he wrote a book on 37 principles of masterful short prose humor writing
he’ll share 6 of them, the first, to start with, the more about mindset and approach

you see standup courses where they teach technique, but beginners aren’t ready for that; they need foundational stuff

these are actually framed at 6 mistakes, and the fix is one of 37 principles

## MISTAKE 1: #t1

You don’t have writer’s block! you think, it’s a mistake. 
block isn’t a thing***
writers block = you’re sad
you don’t want to write, so they say i’m blocked and cannot write

an internal voice we have is that we’re not funny or good (comedy is punishing)
we aren’t consciously aware we’re saying it 
self-sabotage is very powerful
it can make you think things without you realizing why you’re thinking them
self-sabotage makes up the idea of writers block
what is happening: you don’t think you can write anything good, your’e scared of writing it down, and this is a way you put up a wall to stop from having to write

imagine you work at the onion
we put out new stories every day 
you can’t say “i’m blocked and can’t write”
it doesn’t work, that’s your job, you show up and write

FIX 1:
write anyway!!*** 
very important that when you feel like you have block, to just sit down and do it anyway
it’s a farmer who says i can’t milk the cows, i don’t have it in me
the cows don’t get milked and they agonize

what are you writing and will it be terrible? it doesn’t matter and yes
“all good writing stems from terrible writing***” #takeaway #quote

you’ll never get ot the good stuff if you don’t make bad stuff (dovetails with jack handy advice)
you’ll select only a small pct of that to build out 
that’s where you find concepts that work

recommendation: free writing exercise
write withou judgment, anything tha tcomes to mind #exercise #takeaway
ANYTHING, not stopping to correct anything***
do this every day for at least 20 minutes #exercise
you’ll produce a lot of garbage, which is fine; but “it primes the pump,” so over time you get better at sitting down and writing and you are not going to be blocked #quote
you realize i just have to sit down and move my fingers. that’s all there is to it #summary


## MISTAKE 2: YOU HAVE WRITER’S BRAIN #t1
common; typical; esp for writers who don’t wirte a lot
(write alot and practice out of it)

it’s an ossification of the two sides(?)

makes you sad; like the first mistake, your brain isn’t working
you feel slow, everything is a struggle, takes work
after the workshop: he wants us to churn out a short piece every day, one hour*** #exercise

most work on a short piece for weeks! not helping you!!!**** #takeaway #big

creative brain has two halves: #important
editor brain, has opinions, critique, hates you
as we ate, we favor this part*
we judge our own work before it comes out of us*
this leads to writers block
our brain is trapping our great ideas because it doesn’t think they’re good enough to get out
“high falutent editors chair siping conac”

clown brain: doesn’t care, thinks that everything is funny #important
robin williams in all of us
unrestrained almost childlike funny part of you
as children most of us were in clown brain
said what we thought
didn’t care i people thought it was funny, we did, we went with it

skilled pro writer is not like non-writer stuck in editor brain
they’ure not like goofball stuck in clown brain
the accomplished prolific pro writer has a balance of both***
you nee clown to generate ideas

writing exercises use clown brain, no judgement
after, a few days, weeks later, you looi at it fresh** #takeaway
you are in editor brain to judge
this work? this good?
being able to dexterously move between the two, within seconds, back and forrht 
IS THE SECRET TO SOLVING THIS MISTAKE **** #takeaway #big #recurring
this clears you heard of writers brain
when you write a piece get to a laugh line, joke beat, you need to churn out joke ideas for it
and poikc out the best one for your draft
you have to go between the two fluidly and quickly, and you get there with practice*

if you write a piece egery day you are doing this
block an hour a dya to do this, you are doing it

FIX: having writing dexterity! *** #summary


## MISTAKE 3: WRITING NOT RESONATING

you need it to hit
how?
1. come up with concepts** for every piece of writing you write
you want high concepts
concepts with great elevator pitch**
that when someone heras it they say that’s a great idea (i wish i thought of htat*)

2. reference (one of 11 funny filters, ways to make something funny)
key way to make it resonate with people*

concepts: we need more 
if you’re nto writing concepts you’re not generating enough of them
the top writers generate hundreds of ocncepts and pick ONE OR TWO TO WRITE
common raio int eh comedy busines*********
in late night comedy, monologues, desk pieces
did the host come upw ith 3 great posts? 
(photography, single picture example)
they have a farm of the top writers of the world
they write jokes all dya every day
by 5 pm the host has hundreds to choose from
host chooses 2-3 dozen
you need to d o the same thing with a short piee
don’t just write the first thing that comes to mind
you need 100 ideas

where do you ge them? beomc ethem, just type (same as mistake 1 solution)


concepts: must be funny filter-based
when writing, no judgement , get it
generate off the top 
like saying “how aout a hydrant trying to be a banker; can of paint doesnt’ like its color)
list until blue in the face
when you judge and switch to editor brain, 
then ask (is this idea funny? does it use 1 or more filter!***)
this is how you determine if it’s funny
does it use irony, parody
AND REFERENCE

reference is key funny filter to make work resonate
things they se themselves to andrelate to***

wya to get good reference humor is to capture it better
he voice records whenever he notices something amusing or goes “huh” ***
by end of week he has dozens he’s forgotten about
if he listens, 1/100 are totally relatable
that’s a great reference

reference: GET BETTER FEEDBACK ** (solution)
find a group of friends or people to look at ideas fresh, all concepts, jokes, and say if they’re good or relatable

they’ll give you incredible insight
fresh perspective who wasn’t part of the idea generation is priceless
best way is: how to write funny facebook group!!********* ??

FIX: more concepts, make them funny fitler based, capture them better using ref noticing things in daily life, getting better feedback on concepts and anything captured

he wants to talk about Simon Rich, who embodies the fix for mistake 3 
he genreates concepts since he was a kid and has done hundreds
most of them were terrible at first*
by the time he was out of college he had worked at harvard lampoon for a spell
he wrote a good number of funny humor pieces based on these
he is a model for how this works

ANT FARM BOOK*
look up simon rich***


## MISTKAE 4: your writing isn’t likable

people read and don’t like
or you don’t like it!
obvi a prob;
easy fix: in addition to other previous fixes, one more important thing in humor writing
same service of someone in a wheel hari getting off and on bus
is the same service you giv eto writers
writing hard; reading hard; nobody wants to; people watch videos and scroll
as a writer of short humor you gotta do a lot of work making yourself accessible to the reader**
you are the bus company and the reader is the woman int he wheelchair with her sevice dog

how to make it more accessible/


1. hooks
headline must be hook**
compelling and magnetic, so when tehy see it they want to check it out
hook i firs paragraph**
1/million reader if you get them in the paragraph
MOST IGNORED THE HEADLINE

one his issue with a writing class; they’ll pass around their storie they wrote
everyone in class reads and provides comments; he says, this is now the work will be perceived IRL; nobody will read it so carefully adn give feedback with any interest; theyll glance at headline and ignore

who do you get the to finish? more hooks, in each paragraph

AT THE ONION THEY DID HEAT MAPS OF WHER ETHEY WERE CLICKING ON ONION WEBSITE***

85% only read headlines
onion is top humor satire int he world yet only getting 15% of people read the stories (holy shit)

how does it bode well for you in a blog?
it’s like pulling teeth to get them to read
hooks, baby


2. foreshadowing
kinda like hook
plant an idea that marks the reader curious about what will happen
hook is unanswered questions
foreshadowing is like a curiosity
you must understand psychology, what wil make readers stop what they’re doing and give precious attention

3. unanswered mystery
sometimes its how is this really funny headline going to get funnier***
that’s what we hoped for at the onion

4. symbolism
happens within piece
you’ve got the .0001% readers inside, halfway, nearing end
telling a story or essay with symbolism that resonates on a deeper level of what’s happening in the world
THAT DOES THE TRICK***

5. motifs
little flourishes that repeat; thematic elements that ocme back; that are cute, fun

6. 11 funny filters
if you make people laugh, they’ll like what you write
it’s when you try to make them laugh that you fail adn they don’t like

review: your writing isn’t likable
fix: MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE
roll out the read carpet, make it easy using tricks!
## MISTAKE 5: you’re wasting your time

bit mistake for lots of writers
person working on short humor writing, one piece, weeks
that’s a waste of  time (oops)
another way, write pieces that aren’t any good cause concept is bad

at the onion: people write 100s, and they’d put a ton of effort before anyone wasted time****
wanted the concept to be gold before word 1 is written as a draft
most writers aren’t doing this
wasting time makes you liek sad guy

more concepts you come up with, better chance to come up with winning
you write article, essay, rank
based on good concept, now your’e spending yoru time wisely

FIX: vet your concepts
do it yourself if you have good editor-clown dexterity
or get feedback from how to write funny, group of friends, etc


## MISTAKE 6: YOU’RE NOT USING THE FORMULA

All short humor writing has a formula, well three formulas**

one form we talk about: standard comedic writing structure**

different from dramatic structure (another form for shor thumor)
joseph campbell, heroes journey, etc

structure of comedy is dif
why it works well in short form is it doesn’t work any longer (lol)
that’s why you have short comedy writing like in magazines like in teh onion, in collections, and you have shor tsketches on snl
when you want to do comedy for longer than 5 minutes of audience interaction, you need dramatic structure!****

comedic structure: simple
there’s a track; 
it begins at station with concepts; you have a funny concept; to tell in elaborate or drawn out (1000 words or less**) you need to stay on track
tell that joke and more of that joke; broaden and escalate and od not veer from; if you veer the trani is off hte tracks and train breaks
another analogy: tight rope act. establish game of scene (improv) which is concept; high concept idea; now you have to stay on the very narrow line
go one way or the other you fall off the wire!!*****
writing in narrow lane is like a tight rope
so many joke beats won’t be right****
they wont’ work or be on track

established game of scene with concept or headline
then escalate with series of joke beats (gen. one in every paragraph)
put button at the end that expands the joke, turns it in funny direction, betrays logic of hte joke
ending joe should be DIF THAN THE OTHERS* so it feels like ending
opens whole new aspect of the topic <<<---***

REVIEW: not using form
FIX: use the formula!
easy to understand
dif to implement
