Chris 
he applauds chris’s bravery if he’s nervous

in writers room whenyou submit stories, people are trrifeid to present to hardened pros who don’t like shit* 
you konw you’ll get reamed! but it’s part of process*
it’s how you get good, they read it, and they suggest and changes!
eventually your piece gets better

headline (concept,e tc): revolutioning auto industry with darwin mode*

scotts feedback:

many funny filters
too long
but parody format
a decent concept
he cudl have come up with some more***

MORW ADVICE;


scot wouldn’t have chosen to write this
it’s OK ut not a LOL
it’s a cliche, darwin awards
making joke about how darwin is selecting stupid people to get killed
feels cliche
want to select super original and fresh

posisitves: writing is very good, funny, funny filters

parody structure like press release****
who’se writing htis, where’s ti coming from? 
car company? make it clear to reader who is talking
amkes it more accessible****
confusion is the most serious impediment to laughs*****

he employes madcap 
slap to the face
crash
and physical comedy happening, which is funny

1000 words or less

what he recommends is: put it more context so we know who is talking and why
say press release at beginning
“PRESS RELEASE–DATE:”
maybe make up a company
shorten it
and submit it around
get it published in muddyum or slackjaw
slackjaw will point out cliche* so lookout for that in the next piece

James

headline: piece has no headline
no one will read it haha
recommends: coming up with headline firs tand then do piece

it’s like putting humptie dumptie back together again
more work than you need

past life regression hyypnoss session several wek ago which went in unexpected direction
(hook)

he asys, you have a good story
there’s two happening
dramatically happening story of getting hypnosis
and a comedic structured story about competing jesus as a carpenter
the second is the funnier
lose the hypnosis
tell it as carpenter competing with jesus in year 25

he wants a little more grounded jokes, like interaction they had
he says he knew him but it didn’t seem like it
he wants to hear real slights
escalate it, heighten the tension
it’s like a minor annoying***
if it is continued thorughotu the piece it doesn’t grow
it has to build

closer is good
twists into difference
if you lose ending you lose that joke

highly recommend another draft and getting it sent out


Cathy’s piece

headline:confrontation with big insurance health insurance rep

she already published but wasn’t happy with it

cathay uses reference, what we like
then uses hyperbole to heighten it

but we want it to be more absurd and ridic
this lays flat
height until agent is antagonist
hoping you die! 
or it doesn’t feel like it’s going anywehre

too many caveats in the beginning
just have gvt health insruance rep

title is interesting and relatbale
but not interesting relatable and funny

lots of funny beats, good lines
when they talk : you hve to kill you darlings (quote)

if concept doesn’t estaclate you have to throw away this whole thing
you lose darlings
maybe come back, trim, escalate
and do another draft
