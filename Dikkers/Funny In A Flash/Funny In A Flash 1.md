QUESTIONS
Daniel asks about system for organization

#question
Scott: good to have some system, better to have it than lose a good idea
Joan rivers had a joke file: physical area to keep it
Begging for disaster, you’ll lose
Take a pic of notes after you make them

Scott: keeps all his writing and text ideas in one document
so he can do a keyword search and get the idea** #takeaway

someone said scrivener*
i thinks scott has that

#question
James: what does a short piece mean
Scott; generally, short comedy is under 1000 words. Words accounted in writing is about five characters; not really actual words** #important

really comfortable place is 200-500 (super short)

Reader’s attention spans are measurably shrinking 
Old days are gone
looking at swift’s a modest proposal, 3k words
nobodoy would read that today

Shouts and murmurs is about 1k or less
They have short stories, humor writers do those, they’re like 2-2500 words
it’s a stretch

Reduce drastically audience size the longer you make it

Humor structure is dif than dramatic like books, movies, audiobook
people will hooked emotionally for the dramatic structure, want resolution
we don’t have that in short humor prose
funny concept that escalates with a few beats and has a punch
maximum attention to that will be 5-8 minutes
even less; do 3-5 minutes
even less i s better #takeaway #trim

The trick to getting seen is centrally important 
in the past submit to mags
but now with everyone online there’s so much short humor to choose from
how do you breakthrough and get seen if not part of big mags?
there are ways to trya nd do get out there

sometimes a tweet is enough! one line! #takeaway

david javabombs is one of his favor
daly show, emmys, (top joe writer)
one work joke he had, he twieeted, it was great

when justice antonin scalia; he had a twitter account gods twitter lol

his tweet after scalia died is justice
ONE WORD IN LENGTH
1 to 1000 (lol)
that’s where we’re at #takeaway

back in the day it was good to have these things but not as needed (hooks) but now they’re more important

#question
Chris: how long each session
A: about 90 min, in general

#question
Can I submit short prose things here
A: Yeah, short sketch format is acceptable

#question
David: how much writing to do during course
A: we’ll get into details
write as much as you can
the more you write, the faster and better you get at it

#MISTAKE 7: Going it alone

Most mitskaes are things he sees too much, why they’re in here
he says don’t do that but he still sees it happening
writers have an impulse where they have to be a lone genius writing ins solitude and secret andt unveiling unto the world their genius
recipe for disaster, does’nt work that way
all the best humor writing happening, the onion, mcsweeneys, new yorker, simon rich #person
they workshop their stuff in sometimes very large groups
the onion has the writers room
the idea that one person comes in and writes something, ti’s great, everyone excited
in 35 years of hte onion, hundred of thousands pieces, that has never happened once #important #takeaway

#PROCESS
they had premeeting to sya her’s the idea, what’s the STORY, what’s the TAKE, what’st he humor angle, potential joke beats we could see #important
when writer goes to do first draft they have that background (armed)
intern writes notes and they have the notes from a team of joke writers
and editor is there to guide discussion (holy shit) so riffs are on the same track #important #takeaway

writer does draft, comes back to second writer meeting and it may not work!
discuss more, writers give feedback, suggestions
editor guides convo

change x, y, z, deemphasize 
then it goes to a second draft, better shape
editor does changes and whole group adds punch up #takeaway
that’s a process

MCSWEENEYS is similar, rougher version, editor gives notes, maybe you could do x y z
you make adjustments
maybe a few back and forths like that

Simon rich shows stuff to agents, feedback group, editors, he gets notes #takeaway 
DON’T EXPECT YOUR WRITING TO BE MORE GENIUS THAN ALL OF THESE PROFESSIONALS #quote

process is with other people involved
you do rough copy, but lean on them
std operating procedure is if you’re writing piece and looking ofr feedback, notes, suggestions, joke beat ideas, you can use that, it’s their gift; they know you’ll do it for them

the way we replicate it here is we look at pieces in course and give feedback, notes, how to improve, what to do when you come back
free webinar was first session
go to writers room to show work 
TAKE ADVATNAGE OF THAT AND GET FEEDBACK FROM EVERYONE YOU CAN #takeaway

how to write funny group to vet concepts
before you tsart writing don’t waste your time on a piece that isn’t a good concept

humor writing is a social thing
get critical feedback from writers
last thing you want is postiitve feedback, support, encouragement

#FIX7: principle 7, collaborate to win
#MISTAKE 8: FAILURE TO CAPTURE

it means you’re depressed
the onion has hundreds a week they do, and they write up only a few
way you do this is vet ideas
10-20 ideas bring them to writers room #takeaway

you have to do the capture; you have one idea and are fixed on it, want to write this one thing (oops) #personal

mental waste of time; piece will never work

1 free writing: morning pages exercise, 20 minutes every day, no judgement
pore out; lists, paragraphs, get it out #takeaway #important

2 meeting with friends, chatting, jot down on phone, piece of paper 
(this means by capture: get noteworthy funny concepts spooled out to short piece

3 talking: someone you talk to more creatively effusive, your muse, call them, talk through, capture, write

4 pure capture: something pops in head, shower, dishes, etc, you say that’s funny, write it down! 

by end of given week you should have a couple of dozen ideas, raw material you need to produce short humor writing #takeaway 

if you see something that’s really great, concept you immediately get, you thought of but never wrote down, that’s so clever i never put it together
the writer who come up,, captured, wrote down, got feedback, made it happen! #important 

#FIX, PRINCIPLE 8: Master the art of observation
good writers are good observers
they’re always putting feels out, radar going to pick up things #takeaway
what things? he’ll give us more detail on that
this is where all humor comes from (art of ob) 
look around you, at the world, through dif lens, and jot it down 
#MISTAKE 9: Not seeing it
what if you observe and see nothing! “this is my life, and what of it? where’s the humor?” #quote
happens to use if we are humor challenged, read a good piece, think a person has finger on pulse of whats funny but why don’t i see it that way?

look for the thin that doesn’t belong #important 
the incongruence thing
slide of ostrich ind desert
something tha tdoes’nt make sense, work, is frustration, is off
that’s the sweet spot where humor is born
there’s something wrong with life, society, culture, politics, anything, human relationships and interaction, that feels too difficult, to wrong, too hard, there’s gotta be ab etter way..
that’s a good concept

if you can think of a funny solution to this problem #takeaway
if youc an point out the wrong thing, you’re well on your way #takeaway

feed that concept through funny fitelrs to get it a funny twist #important (RYAN USE THE FILTERS ON YOUR IDEA EXPLICITLY) #process

use them all to see what’s more fruitful

the real core is something that is wrong, doesn’t belong #quote #takeaway

he’s guessing some of us have lists of concepts and we’re working on atm
he wants to invite us to post in chat

david says: my relationship with a chat bot (title)
he says that there’s nothing wrong with it
you need to find what is wrong with the chat talk, there’sthe humor

motorcycles are glorfieid sex toys: interesting, something wrong with motorcycle
makes sense

the evolution of toolshed: he loves because it reminds him of the onion, before it was news parody (wah random silly??)
they did special issue, the story of plywood 
funny to elevate and example something completeyl interesting #takeaway #important

to the woman cave: why don’t ladies get cave
great concept

why getting your hair done is hell: irony, it’s supposedto be pampering

jankin and sons: ghostbusters alternative

FIVE YEAR PLSn: five year plan for well is misplaced focus, oh my god you’re in a well for five years

the mistplace focus is he has a plan 
he details plan to get out of well
dude yoru’e gonna be dead, what the hell

need to heal relationshp to color orange: madcap, nonsequiter
random goofball idea anyone would have a relationship with orange

motorcycles sex toys: shock filter

when you elevating something boring it’s irony

woman cave is: metahumor
you have a cliche like man cave and twist on it, you’re saying that’s cliche is stupid
that’s meta humor, sophisticated smart #takeaway

the sad lament of last millennial facebook user: character funny filter
char is millennial who uses facebook

i’m a meilleannl and i can’t spell meilnenli #headline

scott: you have an idea, something wrong, and use funny filter to turn it into concept that’s workable, see how it is spooled into short piece #takeaway #summary
 
#FIX, PRINCIPLE 9: look for incongruity 
if it’s on the nose, conversation report, will only work if something is wrong, incongruent

#MISTAKE 10: but i’m not [] syndrome
more mindset, we’re front-loading the whole process
these are the mental stops, nothing to do with writing process
these are the mistakes he sees the most, nip in bud before we get into

i am not a [] is what keeps us from getting started
we end up as the depressed guy 


if you read good writing, genius writing, you’ll say i won’t be that good, why bother?
terrible trap
real feeling, painful, gotta realize 

EVERYONE DOES THIS, every last one of us #quote

steven spielberg does this! #takeaway
when he is depressed, he literally sits around like the Sad Guy
thinking i haven’t made enough movies, walt disney made more, had more oscars, more famous, has hi sown studio, kingdom,i have dreamworks skg I AM ONLY THE S, disney means magical entertainment for all audiences, i’ll nver be as goos as ihm? 

don’t think of yourself as a wannabe, compare yourself to someone who’s not at your level yet, you’ll feel like a mentor, a role model

it’s hard to completelyr emove from your mind comparison to other
we’re social creatures, ti’s what we do; it’s too yedi, zen, mindmaster to eliminate those and try to focus
shift it on to those who aren’t doing as well #takeaway

#FIX, PRINCIPLE 10: don’t compare yourself to others
if you must, compare to someone not doing as wellas you
he historically compares himself to people who do terrible work who he thinks are not funny LOL #takeaway #quote

he’d watch major television sitocms and say how tf did they get on tv
and inspired him to write his own scripts, joke ideas #takeaway (he is doing dif writing types!)
we all love steve martin
when he came out with his first book, curel shoes, scott hated it, thought it wasn’t funny; otp of the world great ocmedian, what’s he doing? 
at teh time he didn’t ralize that what martin was doing, was that he got a super juicy book detail and he cranked out some stuff

scot since reviewed it and think some of it is good, but in highs school he thought he could do better and that FUELED HIM #takeaway

title piece, Cruel Shoes, what’s the joke? felt slapped together 

#MISTAKE 11: not writing enough
we mentioned this earlier; how much do we do for the course? 
a short piece every day #important #takeaway

how logn does ti take? 200 word pieces, dash off first draft, half an hour, tops
if youw atn to get good, take time and effort to do work

if you don’t have it, do ten minutes #important

it’s priceless
dif than free writing
pick a concept, talk through with writers room, what is the joke beat, then try to execute #takeaway
going through he process is how you pratice something #takeaway

do that so that when you come to the next session, he will ask to bring something you write #homework
maybe you can pick the best one
comedy is about if nothing else is picking the rest one #quote
at concept stage, written argticle stage
even after you write them, you will pick the best (best of mine)
keep writing!

too many people have one idea they work on for weeks and a that rate they will master short humor writing by 3120 #quote
speed up by writing more (analogy of people taking one perfect ipc)


#FIX 11: Practie, practice, practice
everything you do is a skill
nobody is born with an IT factor
no baby is born funny 
we all mut practice #takeaway

the way we get through that; it’s tough, you want to be good
you’re prob not good at the very start
only way to get through is to enjoy it and love the process! #takeaway
that’s why we take the pressure off, don’t compare to others
don’t be too precious of what you write
take crap and throw it away
won’t be as much pressure, involve others feedback, you’re laughinga nd having fun
the more fun you can make the practice, the more diligent you’ll be; not practice, you’re having fun #quote
that’s hwo they get good, they enjoy the practice, the process, it’s fun, and they’ve racked it up to be great at it
find a way to do that for short humor writing #homework
the course idea is write every day, show stuff to people, have fun, get laughs

you’ll be surprised, only after six weeks you’ll have enormous progress by moving faster, enjoying


#MISTAKE 12: THINKING LOGICALLY
this is an actual technique but feeds into last principle or practicex3 and have fun
one thing that happens a lot in short humor writing is writers wanting for their work to make sense
so they get bogged down in logistics 
we are not ai
not logic machiens
are are feelings machines, big hundle of emtions
when we focus on logic, we aren’t connecting with reads; it isn’t working; people aren’t interested in why or how or the explanation #takeaway

you’ll find the funny things you liek tehre is an inherent illogic, at it’s core it doesn’t maek sense, and that’s why you like it and its funny #quote
he posted on substack the great piece, coyote vs acme #homework
wrote it in 1972, and they made a feature film out of it
one of best pieces of short comedy ever
no logic in this peice whatsoever
it’s beautiful
parody of legal brief of attorney of wile e coyote 
who is suing acme company
everything he bought doesn’t work
it’s very realistically written lgal brief tha tmakes no sense
coyote isn’t real, nor ACME, all the absurd injures, turned into accordion
fell into hole or cliff, totally ridiculous impossible situations
too many humor
too many pieces in early humor career don’t have the fanciciful, too constrained to the real world #takeaway

with reference it is maybe logical, but within the piece you have to escalate to the illogical #quote

#homework go read all the aelx baia pieces and all his pieces and all the people 
#homework: with our best pieces you rite, thinking illogically, silly, nonsensically
this is where humor magic will happen

you can use logic to frame absurdity, but not a logical dscritoin of why it’s funny #takeaway

#FIX, PRINCIPLE 12: embrace the absurd


RECAP: #summary
7: dont’ go it alone
8: master art of observation
9: look for incongruity 
10: don’t compare yourself to others
11: practice, practice, practice (don’t sit around and think about writing, not the same as doing)
12: embrace the absurd

#homework better summarize

#homework memorize these nad the filters


# Questions

mistake 8 i lived and worked

question: is it ok to write about well without misplaced focus or to mix in?

question: WHEN ITS’ TOO ABSRUD
A: 

question: spielberg didn’t say these things but he’s not a statue

A: #anecdote
gary schandling show (amazing show) he lieks it #homework watch
larry sanders show is show within a show
big celebs on show, one episode with robin williams doing his schtick
they break form commercial and williams is like is that funny? insecure? gay is like your’e fucking robin williams wtf you talking about
everyone does it
spielberg is dick cheney confiddnt to core
he was pimpoly nerdy kid in highs school and hated negative reviews when he made films

director who kept referring to shark in jaws as whale
so they brought in spielberg

#question
cory asks
Capture" mistake. Is that just a question of failing to be observant, not coming up with a strong topic, headline, etc.? Apologies, but I was going back over some of my older notes when you talked about that and I think I may have missed something.

A: these observations, things are off; we think them frequently but don’t writ ethem down
that’s the issue, we fail to capture
be observant, look for incongurityies, write down

nina asks: i tend to have a dark sense of humor but what has stopped me from actually writing around those themes is the concern that I will offend someone …

a: don’t think that’s a problem
you can find anything outrageously offensive and there is an audience
write what you want to write
gallows humor is wonderful but sometimes its a matter of putting the righttwist, veneer #takeaway
series of unfortunate events are dark, go down easy, they’re palatable, funny
they’re written for kids
think of nursery rhymes, grims tale
they’e really dark; we have gotten soft, people like edgy, dark offensive
there won’t be judgmenet in writers room


MY QUESTION: how to rein in absurdity
he’s eager to see example of that
come to next writers room and future session with piece that’s an example

does he mean there is no grounding it, or is too hard to understand? or too much going on
#homework bring one in, maybe welcome to subway
he is asaying, make sure the concepts are simple and gettable and comunicate in a single sentence in title or headline and try to laser focus on that concept in the piece
and then have the tendency of beign too unhinged will help you
toward end of piece you want it ot get unhinged 

leanne: how to know if you’ve worked too long on ipece
A; if you ask that question you’ve worked too long
if you have 500 wrd piec, no more than an hour to churn out rough draft #important
he can write 3k words in an hour, not good
rough draft shouldn’t be that good
he can do 500 words in twenty minutes 

#important super #process
let it sit, show people, go through it myself, make tweaks so it’s undrstndable
show to people
get notes
then wrok on it more
work on it an hourto punch something up
implement good notes
one more round, send out, feedback
do third draft, fine tuning draft (this is the dieal)
then do it another hour, then either submit or hit publish or post

the whole idea of prace is PRACTICE THE PROCESS
come up with concept, writing it, finishing it #important

if youw ork on same piece for weeks that’s ont practice, ti’s spinning your wheels

leane:: i get repeated feedback but it’s never perfect
you get feedback you get smart stuff back but it never feels perfect
when am i done?!
a: he says story about hwo valuable onion was as a job
the deadline! #important
every week had to put paper to bed, new issue every week
then website, once it’s uploaded it’s done
you had to upload a certain amount a week
deadline made you stop 
no piece is ever perfect
we did the best we could, put all efforts, punched up, everyone did their 2 cents, good joke beats, go with it, done
then they had druple editing: guy redesigned site so you could access stories after published 
and itw as death, writers never stopped editing and impriving pieces 
they got the druple pw and go in and punching up their jokes, weeks after the article went live
he had to take password away from people
no more druple editing! 
you’ll always have the feeling the piece isnt’ perfect, you have to put it out there #quote #takeaway
upload, submit, move along #summary

Q: If we are to write a short story every day, do we need to ask others if it's a good idea for a story before we spend the time to write the story.  And do that every day?
A: yes. have a pipeline, upload concepts as a poll, or email feedback group
that way you have a list, an organized system
that is ideas already vetted, concepts ready for writing
every day you pick one of these; that’s why we must capture always
until there, do best you can
if you don’t have time to vet, get there, start good not perfect; important ist ot go through process #takeaway
if you do it wrong you’ll learn why it does’nt help
get vetting done early and get on treadmill and it will feel good
my relationship to it: poker piece

#takeaway #process

no such thing as having no talen
if you work on it, you'll get better

humans are humor beings, impossible not to get better

q: recommendated reading list
how todos, examples of writing

a: read what you think will be helpful
amy poeler and tina feys books are amazing for inspiration for humor writing, anything simon rich
jenn spira (big time), former onion writer, book of short humor making movie out of it #homework
how to: his books are one many in genre on how to write comedy, don't reccomend getting too bogged down onr eading or taking in
we've taken in a lot in our whole lives
time to putout #takeaway
regurgitate and spit it out as humro writing
he says it's more imprtant to practice writing than reading

reading and learning is sometimes self-sabotage #takeaway

taking couress can be act of procastinatino (oops) so he loads it with actual writing to get what you need #important

caty: i read a lot of dave berry
scott: he's conversational humorist
humor works well for him, but not many other writers 

cory: i'm in early 40s, am i too old for this, starting now, i get this is mistake 10, what are your thoughts on this

a: it is mistkae 10 thing; my thoguht is you're never too old; old is godo! old is wise, ton of expeirence, ton of great perspective to share, #takeaway
some of the best writers  of humor are old
kurt vonnegut is old
all best standups are old because they've been doing it for 30 eyars 
take advantage of your age and experience #quote
his fav experience of this is, when walter mondale ran against reagan, everyone talked about how old reagan is, so they hda a debate, and walter came out and said i'm concerned about reagans age, or someone asked him that
asked reagan if he though his age was concern
he did an aw schuks thing that a great speech writer, dan regan problably
"I promise not to make my candiates youthful inexperience an issue in this campaign"
try to make that joke about yourself; everyone else is at a distandvatge because they have youth and inexperience #advice 

charlie: i started at 41, had convo with himself, wanted to leran humor, wen to amazon, first book was how to write funny by dikkers; then books, courses; i live in barcelona; he went to standup coures, weren't any when he was young; he talked to firend and said i wish i'd done them when i was 20; and friend replied, ok you didn't do it then but you are doing it in 40s;and now he's teaching how to use humor for teachers

someone says: David Sedaris – Got some attention in his 30s, but Me Talk Pretty One Day (2000) made him a household name in his 40s. #homework


scott: ti’s so easy to get started, we have internet, just goes out ther eright away
very litel barrier of entry comprae dto other things
the main thing stopping us is the voice saying we cna’t do it

marguerite: i’m odl as shit, 62
q:  when to submit

a: anytime

what he lieks to do is find the best writers or whoever makes content and watches their first ever thing! sold by oldest
bo burnams 8th grade
don’t be afraid to be that person
the only thing tha tstops us in embarrassment
nobody who listens to and gives in to shaem will give up and stop; the shameless say screw that i’ll put it up there #takeaway
nobody is actually goin got see it, nobody cares lol #quote
it’s an ocean
