See an awful lot
Piece we saw last week 

Cliches in humor
"i don't think that means what you think it means"
- that escalated quickly
- that sounded better in my head
- wants some more i got 'em
- said no one ever
- someone says they like  book, "oh you're the one"

cliches are powerful because they work, audiences laugh at them
but you pay for that luahg, but people reflexively laugh, but loes respect for you
they'e seen it before #takeaway 
humor is a genre you can't steal from other writers!
in other genres you can borrow: horrror, scifi, western

in humor, no
if it's done, someone has done it, it's done

difference between appealing to the tasetmakers vs masses
you appeal to both
the tastemakers are the ones who matter because they review and promote
in a way that mass adueicen doesn't have #takeaway 

more cliches: 
identify as (inanimate object with they/them)
or adjective withs imilar rythmn 
- asking for a friend
- thank you for ocming ot my ted talk
