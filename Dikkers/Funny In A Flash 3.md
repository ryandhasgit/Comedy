## Mistake 18: Reusing Jokes
See an awful lot
Piece we saw last week 

Cliches in humor
"i don't think that means what you think it means"
- that escalated quickly
- that sounded better in my head
- wants some more i got 'em
- said no one ever
- someone says they like  book, "oh you're the one"

cliches are powerful because they work, audiences laugh at them
but you pay for that luahg, but people reflexively laugh, but loes respect for you
they'e seen it before #takeaway 
humor is a genre you can't steal from other writers!
in other genres you can borrow: horrror, scifi, western

in humor, no
if it's done, someone has done it, it's done

difference between appealing to the tasetmakers vs masses
you appeal to both
the tastemakers are the ones who matter because they review and promote
in a way that mass adueicen doesn't have #takeaway 

more cliches: 
identify as (inanimate object with they/them)
or adjective withs imilar rythmn 
- asking for a friend
- thank you for ocming ot my ted talk

he has collected cliches and there is a living, breathing doc called "big ass cliche list" #homework 
329 cliches so far, ongoing
you can add a comment to that post
look to see if you are using them 
this is all in facebook group

#FIX: avoid cliches
strunken white says: avoid cliches like the play (lol) #homework #people
you can use cliches if you make fun of them #takeaway
# Mistake 19: Speaking in Generalities 
often in on the nose or convo style humor writing, you hear general feelings and thoughts on things; this doesn't work
general is ok for subtexdt, but for written word, you need to zoom in #takeaway 

if we zoom in closer from earth to madagascar, mouse lemur in a gogurt cup (visual)
this would make a fun punchline for a joke or joke beat in a piece #examples 

unique specific descriptions make the best punchlines #quote 

#FIX: Be Specific

# Mistake 20: Limiting your audience
something far too many people do
we think of new yorker, mcsweeneys, etc as only outlets for short humor
points in case, whiskey journey, slackjaw #homework 
they're not the only places you can write
you can write anywhere, any social media platform
can start your own blog

megan amram started on twitter and then moved that into tv writing #examples 
wrote a book #homework 
she didn't go traidtional route and tried to get published
she just started writing and put it on a compouter

this is how you should think aout your dist channel #takeaway #quote 
this is the world and you can put it out however you want
no gates

connor o'malley #examples 
soctt found him on youtbue with like 100 followers
and scott thought he was so funny he invited him to the onion office to meet him and see if they could work together

scott found out he does youtube and that writes short pieces and he posts them as parodies of reviews
puts them on yelp and he would sign them #homework 
he was doing short pose writing and putting it on amazon review! #major 
great way to get writing out there, and got him discovered, and he got hired tow rite late night with seth meyers

very exciting to people in the industry
people so efusively creative that thei rwriting flows wherever they can make it
doesn't wait for a gatekeeper to let it pass

Caitlin Kunkel has a list of publicaitons #homework 

you have some that hit more than others
learn and adjust
sometimes it's a parody 
studio 360 parody account
this guy created alt universe where show didn't get cnaceled
and this was the twitter feed #takeaway 
andt his caught fire, he got hired to write for comedy banfg bang and seth meyers

you can go on tiktok with short-writing
a lot of people use this to get a huge num of eyeballs on writing #takeaway #homework 
people post short writing, sentence or two on ig, facebook
they do retweets they screnshot on these platforms

if you get one that does well on twitter, abnormally well, you can retweet, screenshot for somewhere else
someties they find new life
LEGITIMATE SHORTFORM HUMOR WRITING
if nothing else it's concepts somosne can spool out into a short piece #quote #takeaway 

chris wofl says he did hudnreds of tiktoks to see what works

#FIX: Make your humor flow like water
just let it go wherever it can go and don't wait for anyone to let it in #quote 

gary janetti family guy great posts #people 

"punch up guy on family guy" ?

"Cathy is on substack posting every week " (someone in the class)


# Mistake 21: Punching down
Reminds of mistake 4 (your writing isn't likeable)
when you punch down and not up or lift up, your writing is very unlikeable and you lose a lot of people
in addition ato hooks, foreshowding, unsawered mysteries, mostifs, funny filters #takeaway 
another to add is to not punch down 

it also means lift-up #quote #takeaway 
lift up:
the people you don't want to punch is the afflicted, down on their luck, disenfranchised, marginalized
when you make fun of them, audiences don't like, and it won't work well, unlikeable writing

you are welcome to go after the comfortable, powerful, rich, entrenched institutions, society
people like seeing them brought down to size #takeaway 

#FIX : Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
stick to this
if you afflicted the afflicted, you've crossed a line
if you comfort hte comfy, people will think it's fascist comedy

q: funny photos with captions?
a: great. one categories of humor

q: where do we find categories of humor

"make a list of concepts" #homework 

being timely is a way to break through the no-viewer jail #quote #takeaway 
will get passed around more than what's evergreen

q: corey pajka struggles with timely humor and news cycle moves so quickly within 48 hours it's stale
a: it's brutal. at onion they only responded to what they were thinking about, they publsihed what htey thought would be in the news
2-3 week lead time

then in 2012 they decidedt o respond to 24 hour news cycle
they redid whole system to meet in morning, come up with ideas, write in afternoon, get publisehd
when you have staff and time you cand o that #process 

andy borowitz  did topiocal humor and post it before anyone else #people

you just have to speed it up #quote 

it's a tough racket, a real competitive game, but you can really hit sometimes with it

# Mistake 22: Playing it safe
there's a fine line
if you're too milquetoast, it's toothless satrie and nobody will like it
noone passes it around
no one is waiting for the next juicy, appropriate joke
you need to ruffle some feathers

one way to do that is to appear to afflict hte afflicted
appearing to comfort the comfy but not really doing it
doing it through some funny filter like irony or misplaced focus #takeaway 

or be really petty; pick something neither comfy or afflicted and go after it HARD #takeaway 

or if you watn to go afte rpowerful hard, afflict the comfy hard, ruffling feathers
the way that south park has gone after trump
it gets attention
trump sees that and can't hel pbut comment
everyohne commetns and passes around

nobody is going as hard as south park #quote 
they're still in teh safe terrirotry 

they tried to make fun of trasn and missed the boat
they're not aces but they're doing it right with trump

#FIX: Ruffle some feathers
see if you can't get yourself in trouble
comedy is funniest and humor writing isf unniest when it seems like you're getting away with something you shouldn't be allwoed to get away with #quote 
a good piece has that feeling often

# Review
18 - Avoid Cliches
19 - Be specific (as sepcific as you can, esp in punchlines)
20 - make your humor flow like water (get it wehrever you can)
21 - comfort the afflited and afflict hte ocmfortable (a guiding princ for all the best humor writing)
22 - ruffle feathers (on top of 21)
# Questions

q: how to avoid cliches? 
a: google or check list

q: examples of generalities
a: and then biff said he isn't doing that well (gen descrip of health)

he felt as if his face was soaking in walrus vomit all morning (specific description)

q: marguerite says, in cliches list; i wrote a piece with a line and submitted and 2 days later it was SNL and her line was in that monologue. i already submitted and the "i don't have any kids... that i know of"

a: but this happens, someone comes up with idea and you also say it
just look iit up

the onion used to wait on the simpsons to finish airing on sunday before posting beaucse usually they'd have a joke on it

q pt 2: rant about dollar tree raising prices
sometimes its letter to ceo, etc
she didn't know that other peopel were doing it
all these youtube videos about this
she didn't look at those and have had success with piece
she sumitted and it was done by another actor

she is wondering if her specific take on this, it's about punching up, 

a: i gogole something, don't watch, and if someone sees something similar, he writes first, then does researcha nd watches it to make sure his isn't similar after

q: rani is struggline to pick platofrm. do you pick one and stick with it and hit it?
a: don't just hit 1, best practice is put it everywhere cause you don't knwo where it will get the most traction #takeaway 

puting things out there is practice
you see what works and doesn't
you have expeirence that's helful in submitting, even if you're not putting it out there for the gatekeepers #takeaway #major 

think of it like a journal, or private store of pieces, they could be in drawer or on substack and medium
if nobody sees them that's the same as in your drawer
ifs omeone looks at them and likes them, that's a a win

q: shoudl we not piss people off after "this"
a: i've always hated fascism and i've always been a hrge free speech, he'sa  free speech abosluteist and anybody has the right to disagree
grew up hating hitler

having an arm of gvt, fcc, threatening someone's speech, mocking our dear leader, it's horrifying

jimmy k doesn't have right to have a tv show
what about our voice
it was the act of fcc chairman
a stooge , a bureaucrat 

scott finds it unsettling and horrible and the way things are in iran
if you do political satire in iran or saudi arabia you are arrested or decapitated

you have to decide how bold you watn to be
history looks fondly on the bold
charlie chaplains the great dictator is a masterpiece
came out early and ridicules hitler 
patsies for hitler didn' age well #homework #people 

q: dhaval likes advice about topics you want to write, but don't see contet to influence
still happens when he tires to write or sees content
he has free mateiral at home, lots
at some piont you get used to a style, so similar to a comedian you watch, or late night show host you watch
how d you diverge form that and find you ridentity?

a: going over this in TV pilot course overlapping this one
it's importnat to be aware of what's happening but not immerse yourself in it so much you are starting to sound like it #quote #takeaway 
it's important to be unique and have your own voice
have a feedback group, comedy group that has its own way of speaking and doing comedy
if you're a team of one trying to shut it out and be as yourself as you can, taht would be the best way #takeaway 

so much that succeeds is what's not derivative
you can assume you are being unduly influenced by what your'e consuming, and yo'rue well served to be extra diligent that you are being you and tapping into something that's uniquely you when you are doing your comedy #takeaway 

q: marianne, thoughts on medium?
did for years, changed to alg, she stopped self-publishing
do you have any thoughts on what's happenign with them, is it a good place?
seems to be wallowing when it used to be read

a: they're all worth it. good idea to keep your finger to wind and see what new platofrms there are and be an early adopter #takeaway #major 
he has stuff on medium that did well in the past, but it doesn't do as well  now
indication that something is awry
think about being liek water: go anywhere and everywhere, and you will find the places you will get the most traction

marianne: if it's on medium it's published and cna't take it anwyehre?
a: if it's in slackjaw you can't get it in new yorker
if in new yorker if you published anywehre it's published

[personal note] the stuff that doesn't vote well but i like writing i should write and publish on my own #homework 

scott hired someone at the onion because they were passing out pamphlets

q: someone said something about fallon
a: he said something recently concerning
stewart and another late show person (maybe fallon)
they came out and acted like they were supporting dear leader
stewart had big gold bg on daily show
one joke they both did

q: sarah says she's been struggling to write because of how overwhelmed she is by current events
a: you don't have to write about current events; if you do, you can try and tap into principle of tapping into your deep feelings (anger about what's going on)
good satire is pointing out what's wrong with the world and wanting them to be better #quote 
filter these through funny filters, and it can be cathartic
he asks what is causing the overwhelm?
a: i'm just consuming too much media

shes' worried about out of control passion and anger
and hes says use funny filters to carefully address
feels flat but you can feel desperation through the writer and it coems through powerfully #takeaway 
this takes practice
keep working on it
shoudl be fun, try to make it fun

the reason we have humor in dark times is to help us cope with the dark times
we need it and we want it and you jsut have to keep searching #quote 

q: are peopel concenred with ai stealing work?
a: i'm not. they have my books and know who i am. nobody will write like me. ai is nowhere close to that yet, so not worried about it. and he dare says nor should you be

readers want humans sharing human ideas, not robot sharing robot ideas
not to say ai videos aren't narrative
when there is new tech, people are scared old tech will die
doesn't work that way
old tech is still around
there's a million examples

when piano was invented they said nobody will sing anymore, machine can play music
harp, then organ, then synth, etc
#examples

when you put something out there, there's a timestmap, and when you're first, they see, tha tmattesr, you own copyright

q: what do onion writers use to get a handle on what's current?
a: everyon ehas their own sources. scott mixes it up. in the day he used to go to the nyt, cnn, in middle, then huffpost, dmoecracy now, young turks on left, fox news, newsmax, teh drudge report, and you get a broad feeling of what people are talking about, big 24 hour stories everyone knows about 
make sure it's a story everyone has heard #takeaway 
you don't want a take on something too obscure. it wont;' land. peoel won't get it if they don't know what it's about

scott doens't like fallon
says hes' toothless
"claims to go after both sides"
but he is apoliticla
he is beloved and popular for that reason
come a time when you must pick a side
and he doesn't think we're there yet
so that's where he's at
