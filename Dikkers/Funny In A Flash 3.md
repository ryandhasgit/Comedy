## Mistake 18: Reusing Jokes
See an awful lot
Piece we saw last week 

Cliches in humor
"i don't think that means what you think it means"
- that escalated quickly
- that sounded better in my head
- wants some more i got 'em
- said no one ever
- someone says they like  book, "oh you're the one"

cliches are powerful because they work, audiences laugh at them
but you pay for that luahg, but people reflexively laugh, but loes respect for you
they'e seen it before #takeaway 
humor is a genre you can't steal from other writers!
in other genres you can borrow: horrror, scifi, western

in humor, no
if it's done, someone has done it, it's done

difference between appealing to the tasetmakers vs masses
you appeal to both
the tastemakers are the ones who matter because they review and promote
in a way that mass adueicen doesn't have #takeaway 

more cliches: 
identify as (inanimate object with they/them)
or adjective withs imilar rythmn 
- asking for a friend
- thank you for ocming ot my ted talk

he has collected cliches and there is a living, breathing doc called "big ass cliche list" #homework 
329 cliches so far, ongoing
you can add a comment to that post
look to see if you are using them

#FIX: avoid cliches
strunken white says: avoid cliches like the play (lol) #homework #people
you can use cliches if you make fun of them #takeaway
# Mistake 19: Speaking in Generalities 
often in on the nose or convo style humor writing, you hear general feelings and thoughts on things; this doesn't work
general is ok for subtexdt, but for written word, you need to zoom in #takeaway 

if we zoom in closer from earth to madagascar, mouse lemur in a gogurt cup (visual)
this would make a fun punchline for a joke or joke beat in a piece #examples 

unique specific descriptions make the best punchlines #quote 

#FIX: Be Specific

# Mistake 20: Limiting your audience
something far too many people do
we think of new yorker, mcsweeneys, etc as only outlets for short humor
points in case, whiskey journey, slackjaw #homework 
they're not the only places you can write
you can write anywhere, any social media platform
can start your own blog

megan amram started on twitter and then moved that into tv writing
wrote a book #homework 
she didn't go traidtional route and tried to get published
she just started writing and put it on a compouter

this is how you should think aout your dist channel #takeaway #quote 
this is the world and you can put it out however you want
no gates

connor o'malley 
soctt found him on youtbue with like 100 followers
and scott thought he was so funny he invited him to the onion office to meet him and see if they could work together

scott found out he does youtube and that writes short pieces and he posts them as parodies of reviews
puts them on yelp and he would sign them #homework 
he was doing short pose writing and putting it on amazon review! #major 
great way to get writing out there, and got him discovered, and he got hired tow rite late night with seth meyers

very exciting to people in the industry
people so efusively creative that the
