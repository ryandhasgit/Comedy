## Mistake 13: Doing Too Much
Not too much writing; as much as possible, ONE PIECE A DAY 
doing too much within a piece is what he means, achieving too much or trying too hard
throwing in too many elements
one character is aliens, another fariy god motther etc
by heaping things on, they think it will be funnier
a super absurd crazy parade of fun
this is actually somethign that works in longer form comedy #takeaway 
using farce for a movie, or tv show
but in short prose comedy it's importnat hat we limit what we'r doing ot one thing #quote

talked a lot about "one track" what your piece is focused on
laser focus on this
add more elements and it distracts reader, they don't knwo what to follow
coming at prose with dif mindset than movie

short prose piece is quick hit
joke, few escalations of that beat, button, they want out

#FIX One Impossilbe thing at a time
one wacky thing, one comedy thing
one thing that's a little off from everyting else
that's plenty

he learned trick from ernest canoy (sceince fiction writer)
writer ons taff of his fav radio drama series of the 50s, "X minues 1" 
scotts fav show of all time

he said in scifi is one impossible thing at at a time
we have other words, new tech, teleportration or invisibili5yt, space flight
best scifi picks one and that becomes the "wow" element of the show
he explained how it's confusing
they see star wars which has aliens, space travel, big walking dog and robots and shit, thousands of impossilbes
but he says: the way it is presetned, all thigns are normal in this wordl...
robots ol piece of junk, my buddy is a talkikng dog
the only impossible element in star wars is THE FORCE #takeaway one thing people talk aobut that's magical
it's a very clear principle and it applies to comedy

you don't have scifi awe aspect
you have elment of the real world, and the one thing that is off
and that's how you keep things to one impossible thing, don't do too much in a short comedy piece
## Mistake 14: 10 and 2
when you learn how to drive, they say don't do hands at top, do 10 and 2 o clock; some say 3 and 9 are good
he'll use 3 & 9 as example

when you look at a lot of comedy pieces, there is some sort of contrast at work in the piece

either:
straight voice is contraster with joke voice
cotrastic chars, butting heads, at odds
comedy world vs real world (real world and world where one thing is askew)

these contrasting elemetns are at 10 and 2; they're too clsoe together #takeaway 
in driving, you don't have dexterity to move in emergency
in comedy piece you can't connect with reader in a "reader emegency" #quote 
you're not ginning up enoguh interesting contrast for them to pay attention

e.g. straight voice is a little silly; the joke voice is only slightly off
that's 10 and 2

3 and 9 would be striaght voice that is completely aboslutely striaght, like onions AP style
it's rigorous almsot impossible standard that took a lot of pro writers many years to do right #takeaway 
it constrast perfectly with the absurd topics covered int he onion
ex: secretary of agricturel meeting with a giant head of cabbage
absurd thing told in absolutely striaght voice, that's 3 and 9 #quote 

look at pieces your'e writing, what two elements are contrasting, make sure they're at extremes
no more additional contrast you can give them to be dif, complete opposites
if chars, think aobut oppoising char archetypes
e.g. jerk and traveling angel (opposite)
the every person and the know it all (wisened who knows evertyhing)
the dummy vs know it all
#takeaway #major

your'e at 10 and 2 with your piece #review
#fix: HEIGHTEN THE CONTRAST 
he can't say enough his major note in a piece is to heighten the contrast, make things feel more lik eopopsites
## Mistake 15: Going Long
short prose humor piece shouldn't be long
back in the 1700s, the famous modest proposal was long
insufferably long, nobody has patience for that 

earlier he talked about movies, tv, cinema, different stucture in those that allows for people to gin up the attention span needed to sit through that #takeaway
dramatic strcutrue primarily, hooks 
relationship hooks, unanswered qustions hooks #takeaway 
short prose piece doesn't have that, nobody pays attention for more than a quick hit

makes it great for you, a piece of day, the shorter the better, it's easier to write a lot of

#FIX: keep it short
example of modern prose piece from Simon Rich
(it's two pages, barely 200-300 words)
enough to get ocncept out
few beats, punchline at the end


## Mistake 16: Ignoring timing
you think, because your'e writing, you have no control over crucial element of timing, that of time
you're incorrect
you do have control
not a lot, you don't control when or how fast they see it (etc)

looking at exmaples of how timing looks in prose humor
