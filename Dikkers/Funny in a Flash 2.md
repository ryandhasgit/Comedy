## Mistake 13: Doing Too Much

doing too much within a piece is what he means, achieving too much or trying too hard
throwing in too many elements
one character is aliens, another fariy god motther etc
by heaping things on, they think it will be funnier
a super absurd crazy parade of fun
this is actually somethign that works in longer form comedy #takeaway 
using farce for a movie, or tv show
but in short prose comedy it's importnat hat we limit what we'r doing ot one thing #quote

talked a lot about "one track" what your piece is focused on
laser focus on this
add more elements and it distracts reader, they don't knwo what to follow
coming at prose with dif mindset than movie

short prose piece is quick hit
joke, few escalations of that beat, button, they want out
