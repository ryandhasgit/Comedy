matt asks advice for tv pilot writing

scott: you won’t like it, but advice is, write it as fast as humanly possible
do it, get it done, move onto the right
most people don’t sell a tv pilot until they’ve written a dozen

first one isn’t amazing, wont’ be one that sells
getting feet wet
tough if it’s a pet project, you’re in love

finish it, write ten more, then revisit
you’ll have more wisdom about how to do it

tv pilot goal: write one a week
churn it out
after 2-3 months you’ll be really gooda t it

writers room meeting is where we talk ideas?

ignore haters, you get likers

writers room?

scot advice: write a lot and don’t get stuck on one

sophia asks: how do you give critique on standup in writing if delivery is so key?
scott: does alex have zoom group or is it just virtual writing portal where you submit?
two fold thoughts: he thinks its good to perform in a palace like writers room (performa nd get live feedback)
same token, it’s healthy to get feedack on written stadnup matier,a just as writing
then you’re not artificially inflating it’s value by performing itw ell
some of hte best standup comics write good material that’s already great, great concepts 
brian simpson one of best standup writers ever
he brings so mch tot he prforamce, his look, delivery, it elevates the material so much, and that makes it gold
chris rock,a nother example; writers good material, performs flat
when it works, he jazzes it up with f bombs, walking around, yelling (that all attificially inflates the joke)
he wants to makes ure the foundational joke is really well written

more advice, nonsecncial: take your notebook, transcribe it
publish it
call  the book, a bunch of crap by sophia
it’ll be a really funny list of concepts, grocery lists
funny random collection of random, nonsensical things
you’d be shocked at how popular that might be
people like weird, authentic different things
scott thought it was fun thing to flip through*
–

scott sometimes does voice notes, too ucmbersome to write
he goes ack to transcribe with time
for updating and rewriting dif drafts, he keeps them in a doc, and once in a while, ifs omething appeals, he’ll edit and tweak it, and leave it there
live updating doc he’s constantly editing, tweaking
and when something is ripe, hes ays i’mma do that!!*****
pretty low-tech

scott reiterates
work fast
evne if it’s not good, you’ll feel good that your’e doing something
each one you write is better
clear measurable progress
scott: all the good stuff comes from crap, so you have to generate the crap, it’s really important

scott said The Sketch School** with mar cwarzecha is a very good sketch writing thing*
if you have a teacher, make sure they taught it professionally
and some people teach you a lot of wrong stuff lol
someone who worked on a show

scott says you get new voices in entertainment barreling froward
no sketch class
no formula
doing what he thinks is funny
once you get into it, this one worked, this won’t
take a class here
you learn a thing or two but your’e still you with your voice, an authentically genuinely you, that’s out there, and thas’t fantastic
