### Highlights

“All the good stuff comes from crap”

“Write a lot, don’t get stuck on one”

Standup: Best comics make sure foundational joke is solid, perform flat, inflate with delivery (f-bombs, walking, yelling a la Chris Rock)

“Little hinges swing big doors”

### Setting Goals

1. PAGE or wordcount goals are good not as useful
    

2. do chapters as goals, not words, or you’ll just be going nuts
    

3. write as fast as humanely possible
    

4. first time doing a pilot won’t be good; finish, move on, revisit later (clear measurable progress)
    

scott: all the good stuff comes from crap, so you have to generate the crap, it’s really important

### Editing Tips

1. set a goal to edit a four minute section a day 
    
2. Drafts go in one live doc; works on the doc, sometimes revisits it (if good), tweaks and edits, leaves it; when it’s ripe, he plucks it out
    

### Topic Tips

1. pick a niche topic, take insane, counter-opinion (rage bait)
    
2. use your notebook of ideas and publish it—people like that nonsensical shit
    

3. call it “bunch of crap by sophia”
    
4. (scott said it would be fun to flip through)
    
5. surprisingly popular
    

6. Popular and current topics generate hits!
    

### Writing Tips

1. write a lot and don’t get stuck on one
    

  

### Standup

summary: make sure the foundational joke is written really well

- good to perform in place like writers room; live feedback. same token, get feedback on the writing itself
    

- good delivery artificially inflates a it
    
- some of the best standups write great material first (Brian Simpson, Chris Rock)
    

Chris rock: writers good material, performs it falt; when it works, jazz it up with f-bombs, walking around, yelling
