## Dianne KP
Didn't catch her stuff because I was fucking around with my setup lol

## Mark 
has a website
applying for comedy festivals

Scott: we live in this world walking around saying, mind and body are connected and we give lip service to it but don't believe it because our whole culture says we live in this scoiety (most of us anyway) born out of the idea of catersian dualism (mond and body that are separate); which is ridiculous; mind in body, connected to enrvous system, but we don't really believe because of cultural traditions; if you change mindset and accept and believe, it's a super power

## Mine

â€“ good to do multiple feedback gorups
scott didn't have that
they had opinion labs
dif writesr take material to web ideo riting
take it newspaper writing
and compare notes
and it madet hings more strong
when peopl aren't part of the group to create i
they approach it more hasrhly
the acutal adueicne way wouod

it's a total impress me situation
and fit's not immediately amazing, sucsk!
how valuable is that
incalculable
if you can creat something that aachieves or rises above standard
in top 0.1%

Trying to post more

Scott advice: he watches most of her videos
you're talking with volume and energy and passion
when ou talk in reels, you seem subdued, like nervous and reading
thinks if you crack through and talk like you're taking now, huge difference

tat you're doing reserach on trends and topics is great, lean in
if people are responding ot that, no problem with experimenting #homework 
love you're looking at the metrics, see how they do, go to where the audeince is
that's wher eyou'll find the sweet sopt in the venn diagram, what you watn to do, wha taudiences want, etc
it's personal, how do they feel about you, what do they want from you that's going to be different #takeaway #quote 

## Katie
Try new material every time you get on stage
if something goes well, keep going with that
bank the hits into these are the jokes you have working pretty well
showcase or paid gig
or if you want to put them togethe rand try it and maybe it's a tight five
you'll languish if you're doing the same set every time
goal is to get comforable

# Joy
giving ou manuscripts for beta feedback
want sto get to the point she did last month
a month from now on nov 3rd it goes to real editor
this is her memoir, story of what has happened over 10+ years
starte dwith handwritten journals, stream of consciousness

scott: give beta reads a couple wekes to read
and a month to incorprate feedback

scott has document that he can emailo, specific questions to ask your beta readers

## David Calkins
swithced to picking focus for the week and it's been effective
bombing with prepared material than going out without
ok going up with not prepared, knowing he's gonna bomb
he feels like he's impersonating comedians doing jokes, not saying it in his voice
unsure how to do that
can be naturally funny, until he goes into joke mode
doesn't want to be in joke mode but just tell a joke
trying to find what's unique about his sense of humor and how he would tell jokes he's writing so it sounds like him

scott: it's a vital thing you have to figure out with standup
there's a comedian you should know
Emily Catalano #homework #people
she started doing comedy tens year ago or so
somehow found a lane where she could be herself on stage and people responded
didn't have to go through phase of finding your story
louis anderson had this 
immediately recognizable to the aduience and beloved
she got lucky doing these in SF open mics
two years into it, she met pete holmes who saw her set
he was rising fast, and invited her down to perofrm in big club in la
she made a spcial trip down to do it, big opportunity
she did a few minutes and a manager saw her and liked her a lot
and thought he could get her on conan
at this point she's barely five yeras into standup and she submits to conan a couple times
and they start talking to her and book her and have her on
she makes a quantum leap, five yeras into comedy, she's on conan
partly because she skipped all the work to find her true voice and persona
everyone's journey will be totally dif
more you can read about or hear these stories
louis was on scott's podcast, and emily talks about it like on Hot Breath podcast
maybe you can glean wisdom from them and get inspiration
you have the chops, funny, know how to write jokes, getting comfy on stage, it will all come together
anotehr thing about emily, she talks really slowly
her conan appearance is almsot agonizing to watch because of  how slow it is
and how comfy she is without getting laughs
and you can tell someone is really confient when they do that #takeaway 
comfy talking for a long tiem knowing she's not getting laugh
she says it's like connection with aduience
when you're real person talking with them
that's really important, bonding with them like it's one unit, one person
connecting with other peole
when you're up there performing and doing an act it's like a wall #takeaway #major 

scott: so interesting, different media of comedy, and the requirements
standup is so personal
i always say audience wants puppet show, a facade, but they need the facade to be genuine, a real person doing a real thing so they can see what's happening, and it can work
of course everyone is different
steve martin, and how fake his persona was
but it was so obviously fake, it was a parody
his act was like a kid being goofy and funny to perform for you, it was very endearing 
not everyone cna get away with that
certain pepole can get away with something other people can't
gotta find your lane #takeaway 

## Helen
wonders if scott has resources for putting one-woman show or two-woman show

scott: i don't
it's pretty cut and dry, it's your hour, your time
need to find a local theatre
in new york, ucb wouild let anyone do a one person show
you'd sign up, find a spot, do it
so many people blew up that way
ellie kemper
chris kelly
#takeaway 

you should do your two-woman show in LA, more traction than Utah

## My Notes
one form of comedy can be a vehicle to success elsewhere
