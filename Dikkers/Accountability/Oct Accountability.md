applying for comedy festivals

Scott: we live in this world walking around saying, mind and body are connected and we give lip service to it but don't believe it because our whole culture says we live in this scoiety (most of us anyway) born out of the idea of catersian dualism (mond and body that are separate); which is ridiculous; mind in body, connected to enrvous system, but we don't really believe because of cultural traditions; if you change mindset and accept and believe, it's a super power

## Mine

â€“ good to do multiple feedback gorups
scott didn't have that
they had opinion labs
dif writesr take material to web ideo riting
take it newspaper writing
and compare notes
and it madet hings more strong
when peopl aren't part of the group to create i
they approach it more hasrhly
the acutal adueicne way wouod

it's a total impress me situation
and fit's not immediately amazing, sucsk!
how valuable is that
incalculable
if you can creat something that aachieves or rises above standard

Scott advice: he watches most of her videos
you're talking with volume and energy and passion
when ou talk in reels, you seem subdued, like nervous and reading
thinks if you crack through and talk like you're taking now, huge difference

tat you're doing reserach on trends and topics is great, lean in
if people are responding ot that, no problem with experimenting #homework 
love you're looking at the metrics, see how they do, go to where the audeince is
that's wher eyou'll find the sweet sopt in the venn diagram, what you watn to do, wha taudiences want, etc
it's personal, how do they feel about you, what do they want from you that's going to be different #takeaway #quote
