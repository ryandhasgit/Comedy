Scott: we live in this world walking around saying, mind and body are connected and we give lip service to it but don't believe it because our whole culture says we live in this scoiety (most of us anyway) born out of the idea of catersian dualism (mond and body that are separate); which is ridiculous; mind in body, connected to enrvous system, but we don't really believe because of cultural traditions; if you change mindset and accept and believe, it's a super power
