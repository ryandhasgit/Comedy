## Dianne KP
Didn't catch her stuff because I was fucking around with my setup lol

## Mark 
has a website
applying for comedy festivals

Scott: we live in this world walking around saying, mind and body are connected and we give lip service to it but don't believe it because our whole culture says we live in this scoiety (most of us anyway) born out of the idea of catersian dualism (mond and body that are separate); which is ridiculous; mind in body, connected to enrvous system, but we don't really believe because of cultural traditions; if you change mindset and accept and believe, it's a super power

## Mine

â€“ good to do multiple feedback gorups
scott didn't have that
they had opinion labs
dif writesr take material to web ideo riting
take it newspaper writing
and compare notes
and it madet hings more strong
when peopl aren't part of the group to create i
they approach it more hasrhly
the acutal adueicne way wouod

it's a total impress me situation
and fit's not immediately amazing, sucsk!
how valuable is that
incalculable
if you can creat something that aachieves or rises above standard
in top 0.1%

Trying to post more

Scott advice: he watches most of her videos
you're talking with volume and energy and passion
when ou talk in reels, you seem subdued, like nervous and reading
thinks if you crack through and talk like you're taking now, huge difference

tat you're doing reserach on trends and topics is great, lean in
if people are responding ot that, no problem with experimenting #homework 
love you're looking at the metrics, see how they do, go to where the audeince is
that's wher eyou'll find the sweet sopt in the venn diagram, what you watn to do, wha taudiences want, etc
it's personal, how do they feel about you, what do they want from you that's going to be different #takeaway #quote

Try new material every time you get on stage
if something goes well, keep going with that
bank the hits into these are the jokes you have working pretty well
showcase or paid gig
or if you want to put them togethe rand try it and maybe it's a tight five
you'll languish if you're doing the same set every time
goal is to get comforable

## David Calkins
swithced to picking focus for the week and it's been effective
bombing with prepared material than going out without
ok going up with not prepared, knowing he's gonna bomb
he feels like he's impersonating comedians doing jokes, not saying it in his voice
unsure how to do that
can be naturally funny, until he goes into joke mode
doesn't want to be in joke mode but just tell a joke
trying to find what's unique about his sense of humor and how he would tell jokes he's writing so it sounds like him

scott: it's a vital thing you have to figure out with standup
there's
