holly: way to write personal, autobiographical, still being shor thumor, and how to do correctly?

a: yes. back to onion. many stories that are Area Man Does Small Stupid Thing
ex: utter loser to spend rest of day in bed
was a big front page story
todd hansen wrote it, and pictture was him, in his bed, he wouldn't do this, and it was sad thing for him, he was depressed
he could write about his life and struggles and could create puppet show where he makes it into this important news story and it reads as really funny
everyone gets it, undersatnds the intelligence is a sad person who has hard time motivating himself to get out of bed

to do correctly: your personal autobio subtext, write it down in form of opinion or value judgmeennt, and work it through 11 funny fitlers ONE AT A TIME, try to come up a way to say it with each funny filter, gives you list to give to your writers group; if it strkes chord, pic one that makes them laugh the hardest, then write it up #takeaway #major

Q: some places don't allow for your own layout
most places have their own
the good ones have built in control of your timing, and you plug your stuff into it
it's up to you to pick your paragraph length 
you only control it insofar as they control

but in your piece, yuou control paragraph length and sentence length

if youw atn it for other pubs, meryc of hteir rules, abide by their rules
tweak to fit their rules
when you write to publish in your book collection, stuff that you post on your blog, you have total control;
you can write short, 200 words, whatever

q: does your daily piece need to be a first draft?
i came up with 3 (he shoudl come up with 6 lol)

there's high standard of one piece a day, very few hit that standard

if you get in habit of rist draft every day
habit also of doign second, punching up
tha'ts great, you have an assembly line
written, finalized, sending
that's great #takeaway

q: how do you explain david sedaris doens't use funny filte rbut writes honestly?

another exampl eof someone writing on the nose, who like dave berry is telling you about his life
argue, he is adding hyperbole, a great deal, and again, it's tough if you're not already david sedaris #takeaway

q: lost in timing, example?

mazanes use pull quotes, photocaptions, or subheadlines
amkes reader pause and look at something before reading it #takeaway 
you control time it takes to read piece before and while they read
use your creativity and reach out from the page and imagine all the ways you have to control how fast they ingest your writing wth every tool you have
eg: what would happen if you write a piee that had one word on one piece and a word on the next page and so on so forth
dave eggers did this with first novel, his memoir
eddy schlaner, writes "very good copy" 
he does crazy and creative spacing within articles
these are all ways to reach out from the dead page and force the reader to pause between words or sentences

you've got headlines, pictures, picture captions, pull quotes, sizing of pargrapohs, space between paras, space between words, type size in story and in headline #examples
as much control as you have in a piece

q: classify jack handy, stench of honolulu? is it farce or whatever
a: can't comment, havne't read
scott loves jack handy and his short writing

---
q: does punctuation work as a timing tool?
aboslutely. not too small. if you got rid of all punctuation you control timing makes it stremwroll, maybe you want that #takeaway

some people remove quotes and it makes them pause, control readers #takeaway
