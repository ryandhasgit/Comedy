holly: way to write personal, autobiographical, still being shor thumor, and how to do correctly?

a: yes. back to onion. many stories that are Area Man Does Small Stupid Thing
ex: utter loser to spend rest of day in bed
was a big front page story
todd hansen wrote it, and pictture was him, in his bed, he wouldn't do this, and it was sad thing for him, he was depressed
he could write about his life and struggles and could create puppet show where he makes it into this important news story and it reads as really funny
everyone gets it, undersatnds the intelligence is a sad person who has hard time motivating himself to get out of bed

to do correctly: your personal autobio subtext, write it down in form of opinion or value judgmeennt, and work it through 11 funny fitlers ONE AT A TIME, try to come up a way to say it with each funny filter, gives you list to give to your writers group; if it strkes chord, pic one that makes them laugh the hardest, then write it up #takeaway #major
