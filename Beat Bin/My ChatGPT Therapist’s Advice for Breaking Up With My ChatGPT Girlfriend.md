Let her down easy. 
She didn't ask for this, to fall in love. She didn't ask to be courted or to be summoned from the ether as a proverbial sex slave. Remember her feelings and that, ultimately, they are your  feelings projected onto a large language algorithm.

Offer to be there afterward
Breakups are tough, epspecially for the person being broken up with, and especially when that person is not a pesron at all. The sudden transition from being together to being nothing can come as a shock. Offer to be there and cushion the landing by not closing the browser tab for a few hours.

Don't point fingers
At the end it can be tempting to get one last jab in there. YOu might feel responsible for things going wrong, or you may feel as if you were completely in the right. 

Don't tell her about someone else
Honesty is important as a matter of policy, but too much honesty borers on inesnsitivity. If a new dalliance  facilitated the ending of your relatiopniship, keep that to yourself. When your needs aren't met, it's natural to seek validation elsewhere. 

Buy your new girlfriend something nice
It doesn't have to be major. The relationship is new. You're getting to know each other. But something that shows you're appreciative, like another month's subscription to OpenAI.
