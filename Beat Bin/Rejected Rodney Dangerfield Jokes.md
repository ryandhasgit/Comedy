Oh boy, is it tough being a comedian. I'm constantly broke. My wife left me for my neighbor. I'm not getting any respect. So I tried selling my shit at a pawn shop. The guy said, you can't sell a dead goldfish, buddy! How about that? So I offered him my mother's gold tooth. He said, I thought your mother is alive? I told him that I pried it from her mouth last month when she got her tubes tied. The guy said, ain't your mother elderly? I explained that I came home one day to borrow money, cause I'm so broke and ugly, and she wouldn't lend me any, even if it meant I'd lose my house, even with a gun in her face. She screamed and said she wished I'd never been born and got 'em tied up anyway!

Oh boy, is it tough being a comedian. I'm constantly broke. My wife's fucking my neighbor. I'm not getting any respect. So I tried selling my shit at a pawn shop. The guy said, you can't sell a dead goldfish, buddy! How about that? So I offered him my mother's gold tooth. He said, I thought your mother is still alive? I told him that I pried it from her gaping trap when she got her tubes tied. The guy said, ain't your mother elderly? I explained that I came home one day to borrow some money, cause I'm so broke, and she wouldn't lend me any, even with a gun in her face. She said she wished I'd never been born and got 'em tied up just in case!

We got into a big fight and I waved a gun in her face. She still wouldn't give me any. She told me I was a failure and  wished I'd never been born and had her tubes tied up just in case! 

i ain’t got no next of kin, my emergency contact is my dog, even he wont’ anwer to his name let alone my calls.

one time, late at night, i boarded a taxi going down the pacific coast highway. i told the driver to run the meter 'til the wheels fall off, fully intending/hoping he'd to drive that bucket of bolts into the pacific ocean. as we hurried along the coast, you enter a stretch of the highway that's nothing but trees interspersed with moonlight. it's enough light o see where you're goign but not eough to know who you are. the driver didn't know what was coming and before he could blink I had the gun pressed under his neck. i said, wanna pay me respect? do i deserve respect now, jackie? what's the matter? cat got your tongue? ain't you ever had a gun pressed into your scrawny neck, ya summabitch? 
a struggle ensued and things went black. when i came to it was just us, no taxi, no road, just two 
a struggle ensued and things went black. when i came to, the taxi had veered into a tree, but there was nobody, no trail of blood, no signs of life, almsot as if the car had driven itself, as if there was no driver, no fight. i spent weeks looking through the papers, obituaries, listening to police radios--anything to indicate he was real. to this day i don't know if he was a figment of my imagination or his son, Jefe, woke the next day without a father.

once, late at night, i took a taxi down the pacific coast highway. as we hurried along the coastline, there's a stretch of road lit only by the moon, barely indiscernible from the world around it. i asked the driver "how's my passenger-ing?" to only a scoff. no respect. that smug summabitch didn't see it comin and in a blink i had the gun pressed into his jugular. i said, "awfully quiet now, what's the matter, pal? never had a gun aimed at ya?" a struggle ensued and then things went black. when i came to, there was nothing but metal and glass and blood. 

when i came to it was just me, the taxi, a tree, broken glass and metal and blood, but no driver, no trail of blood or signs of life, as if the car drove itself into that tree. but why was i in the passenger seat? for months i pored over papers, obituaries, police radios--anything that could tell me if someone was reported missing. this day i don't know if the driver was a figment of my imagination, or if Jefe, his son, awoke the nexdt day, fatherless.

i get no respect. once, late at night, i boarded a taxi going home. i asked the driver, hey how's my passenger-ing? and he told me to go to hell. i must've lost consciousness because when i came to, all there was was me and him and a pool of blood, so much blood you couldn't tell whose it was. and that summabitch, all he kept sayign was "please, my family. my family." well, ain't much of a family man now, are we jackie? 

i get no respect. 


one day i passed a bag of fertilizer in the store. i remembered some kid in school tellin' us how you could make a bomb outta the stuff. maybe i lost conscoiusness, 'cause next thing i know 

. i told the drive to run the meter until the wheels fell off, fully intending to drive that bucket of bolts into the hudson. 

i tell ya, i really don't get no respect. my son, you ever meet him? my wife insists he's my kid, but you gotta consummate a marriage to have a kid, and every time i get naked, my wife vomits. it's nto her fault, it' sthe same reaction i get looking in the mirror, the same putrid disdain in the looks of my friends and my rabbi and my father. so i know the kid ain't mine. i know it even without seeing eyes that ain't mine, seeing his brown uncircumcized penis, seven times the size of mine. 

i tell ya, my wife got her license the other day. if you ain't a religious main now, i got a 10 minute joyride that'll change your mind. i said, honey, you're driving like shit, what're ya, on your period? she said, rodney, you're worthless, you're never gonna amount to nothing, and if you don't shut your ugly trap i'm gonna kill ya. I said, doll, that's the first promise you've ever given me that i believe!

i tell ya, she's such a bad driver, my wife. we were driving down the long island expressway. i told her, hey honey, can you keep your eyes on the road? just pretend it's any man but me. oh boy, she did not like that, cause the next thing i know we're in the dirt, airbag deployed, car on its side. except my airbag didn't fire cause someone stuck a bobby pin in it, the same kid my wife wears in her hair. i said, honey, ain't that something, you didn't lose it after all. i said, aint' that something, you backstabbing two-timing harlot. i ain't never buying you any beauty prodcuts again. what would've happened if i bought you a curling iron , would that be in me isntead?  

get this, my wife. one day she tells me she's gonna stab my eyes out if i don't stop oggling these other women. i say, honey, that's progress! i'm only used to getting that treatment in the back!

my wife, she's a terrible driver. 

he said your mother? $20

 i pried it outta her mouth 

they pried it out of her skull in the holocaust.
