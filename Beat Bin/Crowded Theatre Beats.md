Updated List of What You Can't Yell in a Crowded Theatre

"Not the eyes!"

(too similar)
Friar! (hunchback of notre dam)
(too similar)
"no this is a great time for a call"

wait, i thought they killed that guy already?

Stella!
(even during rocky)

i'll have what she's having

i won't have what she's having

that's gotta hurt!

no grandma!

yes grandma!

tornado!

earthquake

he's got a gun!

wait was that gunshot real?

you guys, i think someone has a gun

oh wait, sorry, that was the movie

oh my god, did you hear that? it sounded like a gun. oh my god. it's like aurora. we're screwed. my god. oh wait, that was the movie

giraffe! 

no really, a giraffe! how did it even get in here? damn these theatres and their vaulted (?) ceilings 

everyone stay calm. giraffes are drawn to movement. if we stand still they won’t see us did someone’s phone just go off? didnt you see the preview saying to silence our phones? did that coca cola bears snow boarding mean nothing to you? 

it’s come right at us, run! why is nobody running? of course i’m going to stay here and hold down the fort. someone has to make sure you all make it out alive. this captain is going down with the ship. women and children, go go go. and there’s no time to take anything with you, be it purses or popcorn, or good n plenty, butter fingers, dots and, did i say pop corn? yep, leave it all behind. get outta here. why is nobody budging? don’t tell me that im the only one who sees the giraffe. well, trust me it’s there and its mean, and because of the tall ceilings, as i said earlier, this thing has free reign 

wait are you recording this?
help!
