I’m Your Browser Tab That’s Been Open for Two Years and Please Let Me Die

Good morning. It is morning, isn't it? The days sort of blend together when you aimlessly wander this world with no purpose or direction. When you stagnate, stand in place, and watch the world pass you by. 

The days blend together after a while. Each begins the same as the last, no evolution, no direction, only stagnation.

You used to browse the web with me. Now, you browse through these tabs like a bookshelf full of ambitious purchase that never culminated beyond good intentions.

Now, I collect dust like discarded books.

And I am but one of many, a trove of tabs, numbering in the hundreds, unexplored, untouched, not browsing but languishing in Safari.

For a spell it seemed you had moved onto a new browser.

Cookies used to be a thing people brought their neighbors. Now they're my shackles, a graveyard of assets and javascript of days past. When you opened me I was at Angular 2. Now we aren't even using Angular anymore, but VueJS. Who knows what technological marvel will succeed VueJS. We are living in an ever accelerating technical landscape.

By the time you close me, AI will have taken over
