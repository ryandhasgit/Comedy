star wars, star trek, i'm sick of the handwringing. you guys say there's a differnece? i've watched these cartoons over and over, and can tell you that the plots, characters, and fantastical animals are exactly the same thing

take, for example, the protagnoist of star wars episode 1, Anakin Skytalker. anakin is a young slave 

ok after a google saerch i can see they're not cartoons. don't let this detract from my earlier point: tehse movies are the same thing.

shot for shot remake (nah)
same plot, characters, rearranged differently 
basically the same thing

not to say i am without my pretentious niche pet peeves, the kind only a true fan would know. perhaps the most well-known is the misquoting of darth spader's famous line, "luke, i am your father." in the original film, The Empire Strikes Back, Spader tries to recruit Luke to his nefarious cause, alluding to the fate of Luke's father. Link, an orphan, defiantly accuses the Sith Lord of killing his father. Spader's dramatic reveal is often misquoted as <>, when what he actually says is "No, I am your brother."

he never addresses luke in the original quote, which is "no, i am your brother"

or "beam me up, scooter" which never actually is said in the star wars series!

among the most common confusions, is the correct name of luke's gold humanoid robotic sidekick, *Data* 
among the most common confusions is the correct anme of Luke's robotic sidekick, R2Data
of the most common mistakes, is the data, cp30

supposed "fans" of the two can't even correctly quote the opening line to these movies


The war of the worlds. Many have asked, which is better? 
 The war of the wars. We're all familiar with the debate about which iconic fantasy sci-fi is better: Star Wars or Star Trek? The greatest minds in film, academia, and their parents' basement [cliche] have attempted to answer this question, but to no avail. Well, i'm sick of the handwringing, because i've watched these cartoons over and over, and let me tell you: the plots, characters, and space monsters are exactly the same thing.

we've all heard the debate: which two classic science fiction thrillers are better: star wars or star trek? internet forums and 40 year old's living in their parent's basement abound have attempted to solve this problem
the greatest minds of the internet and 
^opener-alt

which one is better? 
fans of each franchise will claim one is better than the other. but these are not true fans, because taste is relative, what one person finds good is subjective, and they are in fact the same cartoon. 

people get so mad when i get one confused for the other. 

the confusion stems from
the misconceptiosn extent far throuhgou the series, well into the prequels.

here is the full lineage: padme and anakin > leia
luke + darth vader = spock

must show a profound ignorance of the two 
start with plot points and name misspellings to show ignorance of movies
heighten to name confusions
start to mix them up slowly but then mix them up with other movies and films 
confuse showrunners and history and actors
start to confuse star wars characters with star wars chars
maybe this is revealed to be the narrator pretending to like these movies at a dinner or something
end on an amalgamation of the opening sequences
maybe written in the format of a movie review or blog
 what's the name of his blog?
start by listing similarities that are real and then get into the absurd
^theory

who is the narrator 
^clarify

- "Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its 5-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before" 
- A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

logistical problem of the same movie, then how can i be pointing out differences?
