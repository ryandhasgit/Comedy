When I found out all your passwords were balls@ck I was stoked. Usually people change it up a little, throw in an exclamation point here, an extra 1 or 0. But nope, balls@ack for evertyhing from bank passwords to pornhub accounts. (by the way, love the feet thing). What's that saying: if it's too good to be true, it is? But after all the MFAs and security questions

i have to say, it wasn't hard, posing as a beautiful woman to lure you into giving me the answer to your security questions. i mean, i didn't even have to send you the risque pics, you offered up your first attended concert and pets name in your first message. i should have known someone that reckless with such a headlong approach to life would have a negative credit score. 

now i'm up to my head in debt collectors, i'm behind on a car loan for a Toyota Carola that was incinerated in 2007; and honestly, you can have this shit back.

not to mention the facebook messages from people thinking i'm you.

when i hacked your social media, i thought i'd find some juicy messages for sex extortion. instead, there was nothing but a single DM to mel brooks, with the same message sent over and over, every day for years: SPACEBALLS 3? 
DM to bill gates
DM to jody foster, woody harrelson, derek jeter, brett farve

pepole keep checking in on me
i keep getting wellness checks. 

here i thought at the least i would start getting yoru welfare checks in the mail, but all that has come is a bunch of junk mail made out to somebody else. how fucked up does your life have to be for you to get someone elses' junk mail?

i've gotten seven jury summons in as many months. i've been on five juries for hit and runs, and dismissed from two because of a history of inflammatory statements about women.

what's wrong with you?

every credit card under hte sun
did you ever even stop to ask if it was a good idea to sign up for some many newsletters?

i've tried to cancel your maxim/mad magaizne subscription five times but they just keep showing up. i don't know what to do with all these issues. where ist his money coming from? all of your accounts are negative. your credit score is negative.

the bank repossessed your hat collection
i've been dodging mafia hit squads for a week. who the fuck bets $2,000 on pony racing?
on pony wrestling?
turtle races?


i'm going deaf from the calls. 

i bet you're laughing it up in silence. 

was this your plan all along? when i got you to send me $25 in amazon gift cards i thought you were an idiot, but was this all a ploy to off load your shitty life on me? was that the long con? 

seriously, is that phone line ever going to stop ringing?

i looked at yoru credit history. who maxes out a cracker barrel credit card within five days of opening? how many fucking country fried stakes can a person eat in that time? i've done the math and it boggles me.

let's look over your bank statement, shall we? 

$559 on wigs
$2,000 on puppets


security question 

Because now that I'm in this shit I have to say, this is to much of a fucking headache. 



First of all, how is it possible for any one person to have
