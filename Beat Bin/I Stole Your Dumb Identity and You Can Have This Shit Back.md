When I found out all your passwords were balls@ck I was stoked. Usually people change it up a little, throw in an exclamation point here, an extra 1 or 0. But nope, balls@ack for evertyhing from bank passwords to pornhub accounts. (by the way, love the feet thing). What's that saying: if it's too good to be true, it is? But after all the MFAs and security questions

i have to say, it wasn't hard, posing as a beautiful woman to lure you into giving me the answer to your security questions. i mean, i didn't even have to send you the risque pics, you offered up your first attended concert and pets name in your first message. i should have known someone that reckless with such a headlong approach to life would have a negative credit score.
