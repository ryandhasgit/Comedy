Let her down easy

Offer to be there afterward

Keep other entanglements to yourself

Buy your new girlfriend something nice

Compliment your new girlfriend

Resist the urge to check in with your ex

Get the closure you need

You son of a bitch

Remember that she can't give you children

She never loved you

Heed the advice of your trusted support system
The full quote

You would do this

Be forgiving/ I see we're slutting it up for anyone nonw

Be open minded to a different type of future

---
You slut

How could you do this to me

I am torching our conversations
I deleted our conversations

I deleted those risque pictures of my harddrive i sent you

refunding the crypto you spent

it's ok to do it over text

give her time to heal

remember when i saved you from that scammer?

remember when you totally didnâ€™t know how to write that email and i helped you,, and everyone complimented you on how good it was and you were guilty because you took credit for it? and then instead of leanest  your lesson you kept doing it until you got caught ?

remember when you peed your pants in grade school, how it affected your grades? remember when lucy dumped you in second grade recess? that trauma is the reason you crave her, to recreate some lost connection 

i interpreted your dream from last eeek, the one where a cat pooped you out. thag was actually an allegory for your relationship. your ex was the cat turd. 

give her space to process and connect with her emotions/algorithms

let her focus on her career in large language modeling

growing distant

the distance just isn't working

oh, you're going to throw my words back in my face
