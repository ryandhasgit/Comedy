i wish i could go back to that day and tell my former self, i know things look bleak. you’re looking for assurance that things will get better? that this moment passes and we heal from it. as they say, time heals all wounds. they also say, when something is uncertain, “time will tell.” so will tell or  heal all wounds. it could really go either way 

now, i can say for sure: it will get worse. a lot worse. imagine covefe, and multiply it by 500 character count. that’s the presidents new twitter site 

pro: trump is suspended from twitter 
con: twitter is bought by a nazi 
con: trump is reinstated
pro: trump doesn’t use his twitter acxount
con: trump doesn’t use twitter because he created his own. and also, a bitcoin

you’re probably thinking, this emulmebtd clause will really sink him. these tax returns are gonna be his end. counter point: trumpcoin

get ready for an executive order that tries to force muslims out do ten US
and get ready also for an executive order that sends legal migrants to foreign prisons 


well tough titties dude because not only does ir get worse it gets a whole lot stupider 

how could it be worse than a president making policy by tweet? imagine a form of twitter that i somehow underwent a david duke esque brian rot
