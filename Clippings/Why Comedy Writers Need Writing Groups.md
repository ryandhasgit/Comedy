I’ve been writing comedy for over a decade: humor writing for eight years, plus two years of sketch comedy. Nothing, and I mean nothing, has improved my funny writing craft more than peer feedback from a smart writing group.

Writing groups have helped me get comedy pieces published at and [*The New Yorker’s Shouts & Murmurs*](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alex-baia).

Writing groups have helped me sharpen unfunny and unclear premise ideas into tighter, funnier concepts.

And writing groups have slowly, over time, helped me build a smarter comedy writing brain.

Writers of all kinds — fiction, memoir, narrative nonfiction, personal essay, etc. — can benefit from writing groups. And much of what I’m about to say here applies, *mutatis mutandis*, to those writers.

But comedy writers who don’t have peer feedback are in for a tough, tough writing life. They will suffer huge, lifelong disadvantages. Here are the major reasons why a good writing group will take your funny writing to the next level.

## Pure self-editing is too hard.

Yes, you can edit your own comedy writing. But this is hard. Becoming a good comedy self-editor takes years of brain building. The issue is that we’re all trapped in our heads, *unaware of whether our jokes are funny and clear*. A writing group gives you a built-in test audience who can tell you if something is funny — or just confusing — before you publish it, send it somewhere, or perform it.

## Giving feedback makes you a better comedy writer.

Giving feedback to other writers sharpens your own comedic instincts. It forces you to think about what works or doesn’t work. It forces you, occasionally, to think about *why* certain things are funny or not. Over time, you’ll start to see patterns. Your comedy brain will grow. This will serve you in the long run. Feedback is not merely a selfless act!

## Giving and receiving feedback makes you a much better self-editor.

I said self-editing is hard, and that’s true. But you can get better at self-editing over time. The best way to do that is to experience the feedback process repeatedly, in a writing group. In the long run, both giving and receiving feedback in your group will make you a stronger self-editor. (For comedy self-editing tips, see, “ [How to Self-Critique and Self-Edit Your Humor Writing](https://comedybizarre.substack.com/p/how-to-self-critique-and-self-edit).”)

## Get deep exposure to other comedic styles.

Working closely alongside other writers — especially as they workshop their early drafts — exposes you to different styles, voices, approaches. The other writers in your group may have leaner or fatter writing styles than you. They have different imaginations. They use wordplay, dark humor, analogy, hyperbole, and other joke types — in different ways. At worst, this in-the-trenches look at different drafts is rather enlightening. And at best, it will help you expand your writing toolkit.## [Five More Humor Writing Mistakes: Advice From An Editor](https://writingcooperative.com/five-more-humor-writing-mistakes-advice-from-an-editor-ce721057a411?source=post_page-----1ded7677e789---------------------------------------)

## Group feedback thickens your skin in a non-brutal way.

The general public (i.e. your audience at large) doesn’t give a crap about your success, your failures, or your precious artistic dreams. Learning that your drafts aren’t all gold is a necessary part of growing. Let your ego take the easier, more gentle hits from your writing group first. This toughens you up for the big, bad “real world.”

## Joke punch-ups are real.

I can’t count the number of times I’ve improved a joke due to a specific suggestion or pitch from someone in my group. “Pitch: what if you ended this sentence by calling the baby a snobby British aristocrat?” is common currency in a good group. A good group won’t just point out what’s not working. On the margins, they’ll actually give you new joke ideas. More brains equals more comedy horsepower!

## Extrinsic motivation helps.

Yes, intrinsic motivation is a pure, clean form of motivation. Wanting to write because you inherently find it a joyous experience will take you far. Wanting to write because you love the playful dance of your fingers tapping the keyboard and channeling the divine spirit of Mother Comedy is a strong energy bar indeed. But here’s the rub: We all have busy lives, bills to pay, and stuff to do. On a practical level, deadlines are good. ==Deadlines help you get drafts done. Simply telling yourself, “I need to finish my draft by Friday for my writing group” is really, really helpful.==

## Moral support matters.

Having a group of peers to share in your struggles and triumphs is a wonderful thing. It just feels good to have some fellow travelers on your journey. A good group will have other writers who *get* you. And you will *get* them in turn. Humans are social animals. We’re happier and wealthier with the support of a likeminded group.

Alex! This is *exactly* the type of advice I've been looking for and needing and *feeling* lately. So here's my question - how do I join a writing group? Where I can find one? I think the *how* is what's been the catch for me.

This is solid advice. I prefer situational comedy that derives humor from absurd situations. I find that better than writing jokes.

```ts
Great article... however... what if your comedy writing group is full of hacks?

I believe Nietzsche said it best:
“Whoever writes with hacks should see to it that in the process he does not become a hack himself. And if you gaze long into a hack abyss, the hack abyss also gazes into you.”
