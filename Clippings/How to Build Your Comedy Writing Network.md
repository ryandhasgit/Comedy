Building relationships with other writers makes it easier to get more feedback and find more writing opportunities. It also makes your journey more enjoyable.

Sorry to use the robotic LinkedIn speak “build your network,” but it does get across the idea of “meeting people in your writing niche and adding them to your circle.”

But it’s not just about building the network, it’s about meeting the right writers and creating relationships with them.

Before we talk about specific ways to do this, let’s talk about some helpful mindsets.  

### Principles for meeting and connecting with writers

#### 1\. Actually spend time and effort meeting other writers

Building a great circle of writing friends doesn’t happen automatically. Or quickly. Well, if you live in Brooklyn, and you’re super gregarious, and you know a ton of comedians and writers already, and you do stunning work that’s getting published all over the place, then, sure, you’ll probably meet *a lot* of new writers automatically, in the course of living your life. You’ll probably get introduced to a bunch of great writers at parties and events and in random DMs. But for the 99% of us who don’t fit that description, we have to be proactive.

That means going through the not entirely natural motions of reaching out to people, introducing ourselves, following up, and forging relationships. This is real work. I don’t mean that in the sense of, “ugh, it’s so hard, it’s like shoveling snow in a blizzard.” Meeting other writers can be pretty fun, but the point is it takes consistent effort over time, just like the craft of writing itself.

If you’re, say, well past your college days and settled into the grind of a noncreative job, this can feel a bit alien. Befriending other writers can lead to various fears and anxieties, like “Will this person like me? Will they like my work? Will they want to be my friend and talk shop? What if they think I suck?” But I’d encourage you to simply put aside any fears of looking like a dweeb.

Getting occasionally ignored or even “snubbed” is more of an evolutionary-driven fear than an actual cost. If someone doesn’t answer your email, it doesn’t matter. You’re not worse off than before, and 90% of the time it’s because they’re too scattered and busy, not because they hate your guts.

The bottom line is not merely to be “open to meeting people”—but to be actively work on meeting people.  

#### 2\. Be generous and cool to your writing friends.

Being generous and cool to your writing friends is the way. Yes, it will make them want to be generous and cool to you, but it’s also a more satisfying and human way to be.

To me, this means being generous with your time and your feedback, facilitating introductions that could help them (i.e. helping *them* network), sending paid work their way when you can, being a good listener who cares about their work, wanting to see them succeed, and generally being helpful in whatever ways you reasonably can.

For example, if a buddy asks for my feedback on something, I almost always say ‘yes.’ Or perhaps I say, “I’m overloaded right now, but give me a couple weeks. It’s in my queue.”

By the way, this doesn’t mean, “have zero boundaries.” It also doesn't mean “say ‘yes’ to every random stranger who shows up in your inbox.” It just means: act like a generous and cool professional to your friends and those you want to create long-term relationships with.  

#### 3\. Take a positive sum view of your art.

The zero-sum attitude is toxic and destructive to anyone who makes anything, whether it’s art, business, comedy, or whatever.

It’s the view that all resources and successes are finite and that, therefore, any victory of someone else’s is necessarily one less victory of yours (or mine). According to the zero-summers, we’re all out here fighting and dying for a meager slice of a pie that can’t grow. This attitude sucks. It disempowers you. *Lots and lots* of people live and work with zero-sum thinking, even if they wouldn’t explicitly describe it that way.

The opposite view is positive-sum: our opportunities and successes are not fixed. We can all build things, grow, and succeed in our own way.

You’ll find some people who are just very positive-sum or very zero-sum, and everything in between, and this attitude can change within a person depending on the context.

We can side-step the big philosophical debate that arises here, but I’ll point out some pretty clearly true facts: Walking around with a zero-sum view of your creative life makes you more susceptible to envy and resentment towards other writers. And aligning yourself with zero-sum people—sorry to reduce them to a meager label—makes you more susceptible to the envy and resentment of others.

Zero-sum thinking especially makes it harder for you to connect with other writers and create real friendships based on genuine affection, respect, and a desire to see them succeed. You’re always worried that they’re about to steal a slice of your pie. It’s not a fun or productive way to live.

In short, be positive-sum, and try your best to surround yourself with other people who swerve that way.  

#### 4\. Be open-minded and flexible about your writing relationships.

It’s hard to know how any one relationship or friendship with another writer will evolve. Maybe you’ll trade draft feedback that makes the difference between being published or not. Maybe you’ll co-write something that’s super creative that you would have never come up with on your own. Maybe your friend will facilitate an introduction to a literary agent or some other writer you’ve always wanted to meet. Maybe you’ll launch a podcast together. Or maybe none of those things will happen.

It’s helpful to keep your expectations low and your mind open about how any given relationship might evolve. You never know.  

#### 5\. You can meet other writers in person and on the internet. Do both.

I’ve met cool, interesting writers both in person and online. It’s best to do both.

### Practices to meet other writers

Depending on your writing niche, some of these practices will do better for you than others. If you’re very early in your journey, try as many of these as possible, then hone in on the ones that work better for you.

#### 1\. Take an online writing class (or two or three).

This could be a humor writing class. Or it could be fiction writing, sketch comedy, stand-up, or whatever. You can find such online classes through Second City, Gotham Writers, and other online writing schools. Pro tip: Look for online classes that include **weekly peer feedback**. In fact, if a writing class doesn’t include peer feedback, I’d probably skip it.

Most online classes will have around ten to fifteen students, and in any class you’ll have a few people who don’t show up much and don’t contribute, a few who are proactive and ambitious, and a few in between. So, perhaps you notice four or five in the group who are more engaged and who just seem “on it.” Look out especially for people who give more careful and insightful notes on your drafts.

These are the people you want to befriend. Reach out to them, tell them you like their work—or their feedback, or whatever you do in fact like—and suggest staying in touch and trading notes in the future. I’d probably also suggest starting a feedback group. The top few people in any writing class have already shown a willingness to invest time and money into their craft. So they’re probably game to start an ongoing writing group. And if, for whatever reason, they can’t commit to a group, see if they’re down to exchange occasional feedback, one-on-one. If you get good vibes from that person, maybe suggest a short phone call to see what they plan to work on in the future, talk about how the class went for them, etc. If an online writing class leads to even one high-quality connection that turns into a friendship, that’s a win.

#### 2\. Take improv and sketch comedy classes in your city.

Improv is a helpful skill for all writers and comedians—even if you have no aspirations to perform improv or to do comedic acting. Improv helps you cultivate creativity and non-judgmentalism about your work. It helps you ‘yes and’ your ideas. It teaches you to unleash your inner clown. All of these things are valuable. But you’ll also meet some interesting people in these classes, and some of them may be comedians with a promising trajectory.

Ditto for sketch comedy. Unlike improv comedy where you’re learning to invent and perform live comedy on the fly, sketch comedy is all pre-written. (*Saturday Night Live*, for example, is sketch.)

Sketch comedy will teach you how to tighten your joke writing, be clearer in your comedic premises and more efficient with your set-ups. It will teach you to write with an ear for audiences. It’ll teach you to collaborate and be flexible within a writers room. All good lessons. And, again, you’ll meet some great writers who are investing in their craft.

An improv or sketch writing class could be a springboard for launching an in-person writing group. Online writing groups have a convenience that’s hard to beat, and you can find people all over the world who share your specific niche interests. But in person-writing groups have a leg up when it comes to creating real relationships.

So, as far as meeting good comedy writers in your city, you can’t beat taking a few levels of both improv and sketch.  

#### 3\. Go to meetup groups, shows, readings, and other events in your city.

One-off comedy and literary events are more hit or miss than classes. In writing and comedy classes, you’ll always find peers who are working on their craft and want to connect with other writers.

But some local events can lead to chance meetings and synchronicities that can’t be matched online. It’s also a good idea to get a feel for your city's creative writing scene and meet people involved.

If you’re more in the literary world, I’d search for events like these:

- Local writing workshops
- Writing group meetups (like on [meetup.com](http://meetup.com/))
- Author readings
- Writing salons where authors read excerpts of their work
- Book festivals

If you’re more in the comedy world:

- Local comedy writing workshops
- Sketch comedy shows
- Events at comedy theaters in your area
- Open mics (can be super duper hit-or-miss but can sometimes be interesting)

Start with a quick look on Meetup.com, Eventbrite, Reddit, and Facebook events. Then a few searches on Google and ChatGPT for the types of events (and keywords) in the lists above.

A lot of what you find this way may not be not relevant to your goals. Just focus on finding a few events that look interesting. I’ve definitely been to some writing events where I didn’t meet anyone relevant, and it felt not right for me. But I’m still glad I gave it a shot. Worst case scenario, you get out of the house and try something new but it’s not for you.

Show up to these events early so you have time to chat with some people, and be sure to introduce yourself to one of the organizers or hosts. Easy introduction line: “Just wanted to introduce myself and say ‘hi.’ I’m a comedy writer, and I’m trying to meet more comedy writers.” Many people will want to help you.

#### 4\. Reach out to writers whose work you enjoy.

Is there a writer who wrote a piece you especially enjoyed? Or maybe a comedy writer with a YouTube channel or Instagram you really like?

Email them and tell them! I’d especially do this with writers who are somewhat near your experience level. But you can do it with anyone. You never know who will respond.

If they respond positively, strike up a back-and-worth and mention that you’re looking for more people to trade feedback with.

Try to cultivate friendships with writers who are clearly funny and ambitious but a bit earlier in their journey. People who don’t have a ton of accomplishments yet will usually be less busy and therefore more open to meeting new people.

Remember: You can just email people or message them on Instagram. Slide into those DMs, playa.  

#### 5\. Find the hyper-connected people in your niche and your city.

There are some people in every community and every niche who just seem to know everyone. They’re not necessarily famous, they’re just hyper-connected. They have thousands of connections to other writers on social media, or they know tons of writers and performers and authors and industry people in their city.

You don’t need to *be* this person (it takes a certain personality), but it can be tremendously helpful to find such people and ask them for help in connecting with other people in your niche.

Keep an eye out for the hyper-connected, both in your city and online in your writing niche. And when you find them, tell them who you are, what you’re working on, and what type of writers you want to meet. Hyper-connected people often get high on making new connections. When you let such a person connect you to new people in your city or niche, you’re practically doing them a favor.  

#### 6\. Keep up with your writing groups and your relationships.

This comes down to getting people in your circle who you actually like, and who are doing good work, and who you genuinely want to keep in touch with. I’d prioritize five or ten deeper and more high-quality connections over fifty superficial ones.

When you find a writer you hit it off with, stay in touch with them. Check in with people.

If you have a writing group, keep it healthy. If the group starts to dwindle, do the work of adding new members so that the group blooms again.

In short, **keep watering that garden**.  

#### 7\. Be an active commenter on Comedy Bizarre

You should have seen this one coming. Drop a comment and introduce yourself. If someone seems cool, DM them. Let’s build a little bit of community here.
