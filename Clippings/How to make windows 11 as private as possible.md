I got a new computer for Xmas that runs windows 11. I know windosws is horrible for privacy. I wanted to know if there are a few ways to reduce the amount of crap microsoft can know about me? Any guides or privacy settings I can be on the lookout for?

> If you got a pre-built I suggest you do a clean install of Windows since it's very likely they sold it to you with some bloat installed. Also, when installing Windows in order to avoid some bloat being installed don't select your country, select English (World) or English (Europe) as your language, you can set your language later.

> The promoted Microsoft Store apps that are usually pinned to the Start Menu on a fresh install. This is just Microsoft trying to educate new users about the Store. Depending on your region, you may see icons for TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and the like. These apps are not actually installed. They are just shortcuts to the Store and will be installed on-demand if you click on them. And, as with any Microsoft Store app, they can be easily uninstalled with a right-click and will never come back. Not worth a freak-out over, IMO.

All of them freeze or crash and reboot, no matter the kernel boot parameters I configure or drivers I use (open source or proprietary). It's a shame because I was running a particular Arch distro flawlessly until they updated their distro and forced complete updates by the end user for a working system.

> I'm just a random dude on the internet but I'm costantly browsing Privacyguides/org and I am a very scrupulous about data "hearvesting" so I will say this (I write here in this post that is only five months old): 1. Download the latest build of Windows 11 from UUPdump/net (replace always the first / with a .), 2. Download Rufus (from rufus/ie) and burn the ISO ticking all the checkboxes you need, 3. Disconnect internet for the OOBE (Out-Of-Box experience) but theoretically you should have already created a local account, so that's not important, 4. Install Simplewall (with the computer still off the internet. Also set ethernet/wi-fi connection as metered when connecting) when on the desktop for the first time (from henrypp/org) and block all IPs and create rules with the custom configurations built in the software, 5. Ameliorate the system with the Windows 11 Ameliorated Playbook (from ameliorated/io), 6. Additionally add domains to your HOST file on your system, (C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc) to have an extra layer of security blocking Microsoft, that you can find here: learn/microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/windows-11-endpoints-non-enterprise-editions & learn/microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/manage-windows-11-endpoints#windows-11-enterprise-connection-endpoints.

I won't lie and claim there won't be a learning curve, but it's probably been the best "it just works" experience I've had so far with Linux (and I've been using it since the mid-90s) and it's the first time it's "stuck" for me. Quite happy with it, in fact. Game performance is top notch - Steam works for most things, and if it's not in Steam, I use Lutris to handle install scripts for me.

> The best form of privacy is blending in with the crowd. It is for this reason that you shouldn't use linux. It has a tiny marketshare which makes you stand out among the crowd, and more easily fingerprinted and therefore more easily tracked. Besides that, it is known that law enforcement agencies even single people out that are interested in linux for more robust surveillance, for example the NSA and linux journal news. A person dressed up in an all black ninja suit in a crowd of normal people will not be more private because they stand out more and thus will have more eyes on them. You will be plenty private on Windows 11 by using an offline account, not using cloud storage, configuring your settings, and using some of the tools already posted here. If there is anything you really don't want touching Windows for whatever reason then just use tails from a live usb when applicable.
