My wife, I tell ya. She and I never have sex. I told her I wanna do foreplay. She said, you're lucky to be getting one-play!

I get no respect. Like that song. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. You ever notice how it sounds like there’s no E? Just R-E-S-P-C-T? That’s the kind of respect I get. I tell ya.

My old man, he was a drag. I once said: Pops, let’s play catch! So he ran outta the house and got hit by a bus. Anybody? Anybody?

My wife, she’s no looker. You couldn't sell her if you tried, and I tried! They wouldn't take her in Myanmar. They said, try the fourth world, pal.

I tell ya, I’m not finding much respect these days. I asked my neighbor, "You seen my wife today?" He said, "Not really, I was wearing a blindfold the whole time!"

But I’m no prize neither. I went to a bachelor auction and they couldn’t give me away for pennies. I wound up having to pay a girl to date me! So ya know, just another Friday night. 

I haven’t gotten much action lately. Even my dog won’t kiss me. I said, listen pal, half the time you're licking your balls; you telling me mine ain’t good enough for ya? Anybody? Anybody?

My wife—listen to this—she hates my guts, probably because of all the prostitutes and that I tried to sell her to a warlord. She hates me so much she poisoned me with a toxin found only in goldfish. I said, it’s bad enough you tried to kill me, but you gotta off my aquarium too? 

I tell ya, I don’t get no respect, not from my wife, not form my dog, from my neighbor, this audience, nobody. Sometimes, at night I sit by the phone with a fast-action single-pump revolver and think, "The next one of youse to call is getting this bullet." Lucky for them, nobody ever calls!

Oh boy, is it tough being a comedian. I'm constantly broke. My wife left me for my neighbor. I'm not getting no respect. So I tried selling my mother's gold tooth at a pawn shop. The guy said, I thought your mother is alive? See, I pried it outta her mouth last month during her hysterotomy. She got her tubes tied, even though she's elderly, because one day I came around asking for money and she wouldn't lend me any, even if it meant I'd lose my house, even with a gun in her face. She said she wished I'd never been born and got 'em tied up anyway!

listen to this. once, late at night, i took a taxi down the pacific coast highway and told the driver to run the meter ‘til the wheels fall off. along the way i cracked a joke, said “how’s my passenger-ing?” but this fella, he didn’t even flinch. no respect. oh boy did it tick me off. well, there's a stretch of road where emptiness is illuminated solely by moonlight, endlessly in all directions. that summabitch never saw it coming, my gun, pressed nice and tight into his jugular. i screamed, "what's the matter pal, never had a gun in your neck? never felt the fear of god strike deep into your heart?" but he wasn't having it. a struggle ensued and next thing i know, there was nothing but metal and glass and blood. no driver, no trail, as if the car drove itself into a tree. but why was i in the backseat? for months to no avail i pored over papers and obits and police scanners for some sign it was real and whether Jefe, his infant son, awoke that next day fatherless. but it'd rather ride with him again than let my wife take the wheel!

hey, why’s everybody laughin’ here? ain’t you supposed to be pumping my stomach? doc, you gonna ever pull these wires outta me? i feel like a car battery in this thing. i mean, i’ve got more cords here than a rock band, i tell ya. i mean, i’d love to sign these liability wavers, i tell ya, but my wife’s the power of attorney. how you think she got the house int he divorce? hey doc, ain't you gonna operate on me? you ain't fuckin' my wife now too, ain't ya? 

you guys have been great. i’m gonna go into a coma now.
