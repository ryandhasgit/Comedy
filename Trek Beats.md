star wars, star trek, i'm sick of the handwringing. you guys say there's a differnece? i've watched these cartoons over and over, and can tell you that the plots, characters, and fantastical animals are exactly the same thing

take, for example, the protagnoist of star wars episode 1, Anakin Skytalker. anakin is a young slave 

ok after a google saerch i can see they're not cartoons. don't let this detract from my earlier point: tehse movies are the same thing.


not to say i am without my pretentious niche pet peeves, the kind only a true fan would know. perhaps the most well-known is the misquoting of darth spader's famous line, "luke, i am your father." in the original film, The Empire Strikes Back, Spader tries to recruit Link to his nefarious cause, alluding to the fate of Luke's father. Link, an orphan, defiantly accuses the Sith Lord of killing his father. Spader's dramatic reveal is often misquoted as <>, when what he actually says is "No, I am your brother."

or "beam me up, scooter" which never actually is said in the star wars series!

which one is better? 
fans of each franchise will claim one is better than the other. but these are not true fans, because taste is relative, what one person finds good is subjective, and they are in fact the same cartoon. 

to the best of my recollection

something about the opening crawl "in a galaxy far far away"

i am don't think we're in kansas anymore
star wars return of the khan 
star wars wrath of khan
wrath of king kong
Samuel L Shatner
Darth spock

people get so mad when i get one confused for the other. 

must show a profound ignorance of the two 
start with plot points and name misspellings to show ignorance of movies
heighten to name confusions
start to mix them up slowly but then mix them up with other movies and films 
confuse showrunners and history and actors
start to confuse star wars characters with star wars chars
maybe this is revealed to be the narrator pretending to like these movies at a dinner or something
^theory

who is the narrator #clarify
