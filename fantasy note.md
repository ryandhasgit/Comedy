just want to clear up any confusion and talk through this so i understand it too. iâ€™m going to use your team as an example.

under system A: after your move on thurs, you'd be 12. after mine fri, you're 11. come the week's start today (oct 1), you'd have been priority 11 because of past moves. there is on reseeding of priority in this system by standing, only moves.

B: last week you were in third place (based on my math, so correct me if i'm wrong). all week you'd have been 10th in priority. that would not change based on moves. come today (oct 1) you'd be 12. 

C: after your move thurs and mine fri, you're still 11. as of today (oct 1) you'd be 12.
