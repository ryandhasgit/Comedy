let's say 

under system A: after your move last thurs, you'd be 12. after mine fri, you're 11. come the week's start today (oct 1), you'd have been priority 11 because of past moves. there is on reseeding of priority in this system by standing, only moves. your move thurs would have penalized you.

B: last week you were in third place (based on my math, so correct me if i'm wrong), so at the start of last week you'd get 10th priority. to start this week you'd get 12.

C: after your move thurs and mine fri, you're still 11. as of today (oct 1) you'd be 12. 

since we turned over the calendar: 

your move to pickup gainwell puts you at 12. your next move keeps you at 12. bingo bengos adding geno moves you to 11. robbie adding arizona makes you 10 your move to add bond makes you 12 again. butt fumble's move makes you 11. your move to add darnold makes you 12 again.

however, all the moves you make now do not require a wire claim, they are added to your roster outright. only when a player starts a game does that change and the wire kicks in. all your moves between now and thurs (for games that begin then) are immediate. for sunday games, you have until sunday. for monday, etc. but every time you add someone you drop.
