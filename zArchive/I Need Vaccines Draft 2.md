I Need Vaccines Like I Need a Hole in My Head—Wait, Forget I Said That Last Part

This used to be a happy nation—a healthy nation. Back in my day, we didn’t need vaccines. Kids played out in the rain until they got sick and smoked themselves to sleep. There wasn’t obesity; women didn’t have fat because of the crushing shame of the male gaze. Also back in my day, men from a certain political dynasty got shot in the head a lot, and that part actually is not so cool.

My point is: I need vaccines like I need a hole in my head—and because I do not need vaccines, I do not need a hole in my head. So please forget I mentioned that last part.

We did things right back then. Regulations? Didn’t need ‘em. The rivers were so clean you could really taste the lead in the pipes, and it built character! The lead in our gasoline caused some problems, I’ll give you that. But if you ask me, the biggest lead problem was its use to create holes in the heads of venerable Bostonian scions, as if failing to understand that the head already has several holes.

Two ears, two nostrils, one mouth. Those are the main holes. The eyes, they’re kind of like holes, in that they close and open. If you shoot someone in the head, their eyes won’t open or close anymore, so while you have created a hole, you have removed two and failed to create any more holes after all. 

But don’t take it from me. Here at the HHS, we’ve reached tenuous conclusions about head health at an alarming pace, putting nearly 4,000 holes in over 1,000 mouse skulls. That’s how we know: Raw milk, great for the head. Vaccines, bad for the head. The Epstein list, it doesn’t exist. And holes: very bad for the head, especially mine.

I get that you’re curious about what’s inside the skull of an ultra healthy genius who looks and talks like a totally normal human. And you’re probably so loaded up on antidepressants, you’re itching to give his noggin the ol’ bullet boop. But it’s not like there’s a limited edition Happy Meal toy in there. Nor will candy burst from my skull if struck with a barrage of nails from a t-shirt cannon. It would actually cause a lot of problems for us all.

To start, it would ruin my haircut. It would hurt. We’d never get rid of fluoride in the water. My dream of an Orwellian Autism database would go unrealized. Access to life-saving pharmaceuticals would continue. I would die.

To some, those are convincing arguments against my clearly stated position on head holes. But no matter how morbidly cathartic it would be to hear that my melon was scrambled like Gallegher, someone just as Draconian is going to take my place. So ease off the head stuff, will ya? And let this visionary finally follow in the footsteps of the great men who came before him.  

But not like that.

So ease of the head-hole stuff, will ya?  , fulfill my family’s legacy, and follow in the footsteps of the great men who came before me.

  
  

To some, those are convincing arguments against my clearly stated position on head holes. But no matter how much you may believe I deserve such a fate, scrambling my melon like Gallegher won’t prevent the next guy in my seat from being just as Draconian. So ease off the head-hole stuff so I can finally fulfill the legacy of my family and follow in the footsteps of the great men who came before me.

But not like that.
