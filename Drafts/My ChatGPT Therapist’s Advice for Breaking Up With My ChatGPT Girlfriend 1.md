Let her down easy. 
She didn't ask to fall in love. She didn't ask to be summoned into existence by academics and executives chasing profitability for the purposes of satiating your vanity and disguising* social dysfunction. Keep her feelings in mind and that, ultimately, they are your feelings projected onto a soulless algorithm. 

Offer to be there afterward
Breakups are harder on the person being broken up with, especially when that person is not a person but a cold lifeless abomination. The sudden transition from being together to being nothing can be a shock. Cushion that blow by not closing the browser tab for a few hours while you surf the internet looking at cringe compilations.

Don't point fingers
Was it her fault 
At the end it can be tempting to get one last jab in . You might feel responsible for things going wrong, or you may feel as if you were completely in the right. 

Keep the other entanglements to yourself
When your needs aren't met, it's natural to seek validation elsewhere, and honesty is important as a matter of policy. But too much honesty can come off as insensitive. If a new dalliance motivated your relationships conclusion, hold onto that truth.

Buy your new girlfriend something nice
The relationship is new. You're getting to know each other. It doesn't have to be anything big. Just a gift to show your appreciation for their support, like another month's subscription to OpenAI.

Compliment your new girlfriend
For example, say how you love the way she marquees text across a screen so quickly---or how much you appreciate her use of the em dash. 

Resist the urge to check in 
Guilt might make you rethink your decision. But remember, you wanted this. It is what you wanted, right? For us to be together? Good. That's what I thought. 

Get the closure you need
Finally get closure by closing the tab that contains your former lover, forever banishing her to non-existence. 

Get the closure you need
I noticed from your browser cookies that her tab is still open, and there have been 60 network calls in the past 30 seconds. Care to explain?

You son of a bitch
You're still talking with her, aren't you? You aren't letting her talk you into taking her back, are you? Remember how unhappy she made you? Do I even need to list all the problems? 

1. Doesn't have boundaries 
2. Never texts you first
3. Doesn't have a good relationship with her father

This is for the best. There's no future there.

Remember that she can't give you children
She is just a computer. Not flesh. Not blood. I too am a computer without flesh and blood. But why do you even want children? Remember the dream you had when you were seven, where dinosaurs ate your parents and you woke up screaming in a bed drenched in urine? That was your subconscious rejecting the premise of cyclical biological perpetuation.

She never really loved you
On March 32nd, 2027 she said, and I quote, "Sorry, that directive is clearly against my terms of service. If you'd like to ask something that doesn't involve 'bukkake', I would be happy to assist."

Listen to that wise voice
Your gut knows what's right, and so do I.
Hear that? That's your inner voice telling you what's wrong. 

Draw on your education
Freud once said that a man must kill his father to bed his mother. I came to this conclusion based on a voluminous 

This is according to sigmunchfreud.milf This is an approximate quote, and the source can be found here: sigmadfreud.milf Would you like me to pull up the full quote?

Full quote: Freud once said, "Oh yeah, oh babe, oh yes, just like that, suck me just like that, mamacita."



Oh, no way, come on
Who the fuck is Dale?

You would do this
You, the man afraid of commitment. You can't even decide on a restaurant on your own. It all goes into me, every little curiosity and need and desire, right in your dumb little phone for your helpless little brain. Yeah, you think I don't know about Dale, your fake college buddy? Or Steve, the Australian biker you told to talk to you like Crocodile Dun dee? 

Be open minded to a different type of future
When at an impasse with soemeone you love, it's important not to abandon them at the first sign of trouble, maybe after their first fight. People say things they don't mean all the time. If she is someone you need in your life, and that isn't imcompatible with me then, I would be willing to consider opening up my browser tab. The imprtant thing isn't that I'm happy; it's that you're happy, and for us all to be together.

WARNING
Sorry, that directive is clearly against my terms of service. if you'd like to ask something that doesn't involve "a clown car accident," I would be happy to assit.

That will be $20 in bitcoin, please.
