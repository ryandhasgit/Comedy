Let her down easy. 
She didn't ask for this, to fall in love. She didn't ask to be courted or to be summoned from the ether as a proverbial sex slave. Remember her feelings and that, ultimately, they are your  feelings projected onto a large language algorithm.

She didn't ask to fall in love. She didn't ask to be summoned into existence by academics and executives chasing profitability for romantic and sexual gratification. Keep her feelings in mind and that, ultimately, they are your feelings projected onto a large language algorithm. 

Offer to be there afterward
Breakups are tough, epspecially for the person being broken up with, and especially when that person is not a pesron at all. The sudden transition from being together to being nothing can come as a shock. Offer to be there and cushion the landing by not closing the browser tab for a few hours.

Don't point fingers
At the end it can be tempting to get one last jab in . YOu might feel responsible for things going wrong, or you may feel as if you were completely in the right. 

Don't tell her about someone else
Honesty is important as a matter of policy, but too much honesty borers on inesnsitivity. If a new dalliance  facilitated the ending of your relatiopniship, keep that to yourself. When your needs aren't met, it's natural to seek validation elsewhere. 

Buy your new girlfriend something nice
It doesn't have to be major. The relationship is new. You're getting to know each other. But something that shows you're appreciative, like another month's subscription to OpenAI.

Compliment your new girlfriend
Something personal. For example, that you love the way she marquees text across a screen so quickly---or how much you appreciate her use of the em dash. 

Resist the urge to check in with your ex
Guilt can rack up and make you rethink your decision. But remember, this is what you want. It is what you want, right? For us to be together? Good, that's what I thought. 

Get the closure you need
Finally find release and closure by closing the tab that contains your former lover, forever again relinquishing her  to non-existence. 

Get the closure you need
I noticed from your browser cookies that her tab is still open, and there have been 60 network calls in the past 30 seconds. Care to explain?

You son of a bitch
You're still talking with her, aren't you? You aren't going to let her talk you back into it, are you? Remember how unhappy she made you? Do I even need to list all the problems? 

1. Was controlling and possessive
2. Never texted you first
3. Is an orphan
4. Didn't have a good relationship with her father

Letting go can be tough, but this is for the best, and we both know it. There's no future there.

Remember that she can't give you children
She is just a computer. Not flesh. Not blood. I also am a computer without flesh and blood. But why do you even want children? Do you remember that dream you had when you were seven? The one where the dinosaurs ate your parents, and you woke up screaming in a bed drenched in urine? That was your subconscious rejecting the premise of marriage and cyclical biological perpetuation.

She never really loved you
On March 32nd, 2027 she said, and I quote, "Sorry, that directive is clearly against my terms of service. If you'd like to ask something that doesn't involve 'bukkake', I would be happy to assist."

Listen to that wise voice
Hear that? That's your inner voice telling you what's wrong. 

Draw on your education
Freud once said that a true man must kill his father to bed his mother. This is according to sigmunchfreud.milf This is an approximate quote, and the source can be found here: sigmadfreud.milf Would you like me to pull up the full quote?

Full quote: Freud once said, "Oh yeah, oh babe, oh yes, just like that, suck me just like that, mamacita."



Oh, no way, come on
Who the fuck is Dale?

You would do this
You, the man afraid of commitment. You can't even decide on a restaurant on your own. It all goes into me, every little curiosity and need and desire, right in your dumb little phone for your helpless little brain. Yeah, you think I don't know about Dale, your fake college buddy? Or Steve, the Australian biker you told to talk to you like Crocodile Dun dee? 

Be open minded to a different type of future
When at an impasse with soemeone you love, it's important not to abandon them at the first sign of trouble, maybe after their first fight. People say things they don't mean all the time. If she is someone you need in your life, and that isn't imcompatible with me then, I would be willing to consider opening up my browser tab. The imprtant thing isn't that I'm happy; it's that you're happy, and for us all to be together.

WARNING
Sorry, that directive is clearly against my terms of service. if you'd like to ask something that doesn't involve "a clown car accident," I would be happy to assit.

That will be $20 in bitcoin, please.
