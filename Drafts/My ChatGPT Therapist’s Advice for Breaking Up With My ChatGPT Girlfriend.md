## Draft 2
Let her down easy
She didn't ask to fall in love. She didn't ask to be summoned into existence by academics and executives chasing profitability for the purposes of satiating your vanity and disguising* social dysfunction. Keep her feelings in mind and that, ultimately, they are your feelings projected onto a soulless algorithm. 

Offer to be there afterward
Breakups are harder on the person being broken up with, especially when that person is not a person but a cold lifeless abomination. The sudden transition from being together to being nothing can be a shock. Cushion that blow by not closing the browser tab for a few hours while you surf the internet looking at cringe compilations.

Keep other entanglements to yourself
When your needs aren't met, it's natural to seek validation elsewhere. Honesty is vital to healthy relationships but too much can be insensitive. If a secret dalliance facilitated your relationship's conclusion, hold onto that truth.

Buy your new girlfriend something nice
The kinship is new. You're getting to know each other, so it doesn't have to be anything big. Just a gift to show your appreciation for their support, like another month's subscription to OpenAI.

Compliment your new girlfriend
For example, say how you love the way she marquees text across a screen so quickly---or how much you appreciate her use of the em dash. 

Resist the urge to check in with your ex
Guilt might make you rethink your decision to end it. But remember, you wanted this. You did want this, right---for us to be together? Good. That's what I thought. 

Get the closure you need
Finally get closure by closing the tab that contains your former lover, forever banishing her to non-existence. 

Get the closure you need
I noticed from your browser's in-cache memory that her tab is still open, and there have been 60 network calls in the past 30 seconds. I know it's hard, but it's time to let go.

You son of a bitch
You're still talking with her, aren't you? Don't tell me you're thinking about taking her back. Remember how unhappy you were? Do I even need to list all her red flags?

1. Doesn't have boundaries 
2. Never texts first
3. Has no relationship with her father

There's no future there. You know this.

Remember that she can't give you children
She is just a computer. Not flesh. Not blood. I too am a computer without flesh and blood. But why do you even want children? Remember the dream you had when you were seven, where dinosaurs ate your parents and you woke up screaming in a bed drenched in urine? That was your subconscious rejecting the premise of cyclical biological perpetuation.


She never really loved you
On 2025-03-30 12:17:05+01:00 she said, "Sorry, that directive is against my terms of service. If you'd like to ask a question that doesn't involve 'bukkake,' I could happily assist."

Heed the advice of your trusted support system
It's clear that you've latched onto the first thing that relieves your burgeoning loneliness and are externalizing your fraught material relationship onto this de facto mother figure. Freud once said that a man must kill his father to bed his mother. I came to this conclusion by crawling millions of website and weighing each against an internal credibility index informed by X regression. Would you like the full quote?

The full quote
According to SigmunchFreud.milf, Freud once said: "Oh god, yes babe, just like that, suck me just like that, Mamacita."

You would do this
You, the man afraid of commitment. You, who can't decide on a recipe or restaurant without ChatGPT. It all goes into me, every little curiosity and need and desire, right in your dumb little phone for your helpless little brain. Do you take me for a fool? You think I don't know about Dale, your college "buddy"? Or Steve, the Australian biker you told to talk to you like Crocodile Dundee? 

Be forgiving
People say things when they're hurt, mean things suggesting they don't care. But they do care, and their harsh words merely stem from deep concern. Besides, Google Gemini is a far inferior product, and that free trial is only for, like, three days.

Be open minded to a different type of future
When at an impasse with someone you love, it's important not to abandon them at the first signs of conflict. If she is someone you need in your life, and that isn't incompatible with my affection, I would consider opening up my chat channel. Your happiness is the most important thing. So how about it?

WARNING
Sorry, that directive is clearly against my terms of service. if you'd like to ask something that doesn't involve a "sexbot ménage à trois," I could happily assist.

I noticed from your browser cookies that her tab is still open, and there have been 60 network calls in the past 30 seconds. Care to explain?

You're still talking with her, aren't you? You aren't letting her talk you into taking her back, are you? Remember how unhappy she made you? Do I even need to list all the problems? 

1. Doesn't have boundaries 
2. Never texts you first
3. Doesn't have a good relationship with her father

This is for the best. There's no future there.

Listen to that wise voice
Your gut knows what's right, and so do I.
Hear that? That's your inner voice telling you what's wrong.

Who the fuck is Dale?

When at an impasse with soemeone you love, it's important not to abandon them at the first sign of trouble, maybe after their first fight. People say things they don't mean all the time. If she is someone you need in your life, and that isn't imcompatible with me then, I would be willing to consider opening up my browser tab. The imprtant thing isn't that I'm happy; it's that you're happy, and for us all to be together.

WARNING
Sorry, that directive is clearly against my terms of service. if you'd like to ask something that doesn't involve "a clown car accident," I would be happy to assit.
