I Need Vaccines Like I Need a Hole in My Head—Wait, Forget I Said That Last Part

This used to be a happy nation—a healthy nation. Back in my day, children didn’t need vaccines. You played out in the rain until you got sick and smoked yourself to sleep. There wasn’t obesity; women didn’t have fat because of the crushing shame of the male gaze. Also back in my day, men from a particular political dynasty got shot in the head a lot, and that part actually is not so cool.

My point is: I need vaccines like I need a hole in my head—and because I do not need vaccines, I do not need a hole in my head. So forget I mentioned that last part.

We did things right back then. Regulations? Didn’t need ‘em. The rivers were so clean you could really taste the lead in the pipes, and it built character! The lead in our gasoline caused some problems, I’ll give you that. But if you ask me, the biggest lead problem was using it to create holes in the heads of public servants with powerful family influence, as if failing to understand that the head already has several holes.

Two ears, two nostrils, one mouth. Those are the main holes. The eyes, they’re kind of like holes, in that they close and open. If you shoot someone in the head, their eyes won’t open or close anymore, so really, you're losing holes

I get that you’re curious about what’s inside the skull of an ultra healthy genius who looks and talks like a totally normal human. And you’re probably so loaded up on antidepressants, you’re itching to give his noggin an inquisitive yet forceful boop. But it’s not like there’s a limited edition Happy Meal toy in there. Nor will candy burst from my skull if struck with a barrage of nails from a t-shirt cannon.

But don’t take it from me. Here at the HHS, we’ve reached tenuous conclusions about head health at an alarming pace, putting nearly 4,000 holes in over 1,000 mouse skulls. That’s how we know: Raw milk, great for the head. Vaccines, bad for the head. The Epstein list, it doesn’t exist. And holes: very bad for the head, especially mine.

That’s not to say the untold consequences it would unleash for everyone. 

It would actually cause a lot of problems for everyone. To start, it would ruin my haircut. It would hurt. We’d never get rid of all the fluoride in our water. Access to life-saving pharmaceuticals and abortion medication would continue. I would die.

To some, those are convincing arguments against my clearly stated position on head holes. But no matter how morbidly cathartic it would be to hear that my melon was scrambled in the dramatic fashion of a Gallegher show, someone just as Draconian will take my place. So ease off the head stuff, will ya? And this visionary get on with the kind of work that will assuredly follow in the footsteps of the great men who came before me.

And let this visionary finally follow in the footsteps of the great men who came before him.  

But not, you know, like that.
