I Need Vaccines Like I Need a Hole in My Head—Wait, Forget I Said That Last Part

This used to be a happy nation—a healthy nation. Back in my day, children didn’t need vaccines. You played out in the rain until you got sick and smoked yourself to sleep. There wasn’t obesity; women didn’t have fat because of the crushing shame of the male gaze. Also back in my day, men from a particular political dynasty got shot in the head a lot, and that part actually is not so cool.

My point is: I need vaccines like I need a hole in my head—and because I do not need vaccines, I do not need a hole in my head. So forget I mentioned that last part.

We did things right back then. Regulations? Didn’t need ‘em. The rivers were so clean you could really taste the lead in the pipes, and it built character! The lead in our gasoline caused some problems, I’ll give you that. But if you ask me, the biggest lead problem was using it to create holes in the heads of public servants with powerful family influence, as if failing to understand that the head already has several holes.

Two ears, two nostrils, one mouth. Those are the main holes. The eyes, they’re kind of like holes, in that they close and open. If you shoot someone in the head, their eyes won’t open or close anymore and you'll actually have fewer holes than you started with. So at that point, why bother?

But don’t take it from me. Here at the HHS, we’ve reached tenuous conclusions about public health at an alarming pace, putting over forty thousand holes in the heads of nearly a hundred mice. That’s how we know: Raw milk, great for the head. Vaccines, bad for the head. The Epstein list doesn’t exist. And holes: very bad for the head, especially mine.

Listen, I get that you're curious what's inside the skull of healthy genius who looks and talks like a totally normal human. And you’re probably so loaded up on antidepressants, you’re itching to see his melon scrambled a la Gallegher. But I assure you, no matter how funny it is to joke about it, it would be morbid, horrendous, and emblematic of the ever-worsening political division that seems to sink further and further into chaos—even if it would be a ltitle funny. But I assure you, no matter how right that broken clock may be,  someone just as Draconian will wind up taking my place. So let me get back to doing the kind of hard work that will affix me in the annals of history and follow in the footsteps of my storied family.

But you know, not like like.
