My wife, I tell ya. She and I never have sex. I told her I wanna do foreplay. She said, you're lucky to be getting one-play!

I get no respect. Like that song. You know that song? R-E-S-P-E-C-T. You ever notice how it sounds like there’s no E? Just R-E-S-P-C-T? That’s the kind of respect I get. I tell ya.

My old man, he was a drag. I once said: Pops, let’s play catch! So he ran outta the house and got hit by a bus.

Have you seen my wife? She's no looker. You couldn't sell her if you tried, and I tried! They wouldn't take her in Myanmar. They said, try the fourth world, pal.

I tell ya, I’m not finding much respect these days. I asked my neighbor, "You seen my wife today?" He said, "Not really, I was wearing a blindfold the whole time!"

But ya know, I’m no prize either. I went to a bachelor auction once and they couldn’t give me away for pennies. I wound up having to pay a girl to date me! So ya know, just another Friday night. 

She’s something, my wife. The other day I said, "See ya later, honey!" She told me she'd like to see other people later. Then she fucked my neighbor. Anybody? Anybody?

Since my wife left me for my neighbor, I haven’t gotten much action. Even my dog won’t kiss me. I said, listen pal, half the time you're licking your balls; you telling me mine ain’t good enough for ya? 

My wife---listen to this---she hates my guts, probably because of all the prostitutes and that I tried to sell her into slavery. She hates me so much she poisoned me with a toxin found only in goldfish. I said, it’s bad enough you tried to kill me, but you gotta off my aquarium too? 

I tell ya, I don’t get no respect, not from my wife, not form my dog, from my neighbor, the post office, this audience, nobody. Sometimes, at night I sit by the phone with a fast action single pump revolver and think, "The next one of youse to call, that’s who's getting this bullet." Lucky for them, nobody ever calls!

Oh boy, is it tough being a comedian. I'm constantly broke. My wife left me for my neighbor. I'm not getting any respect. So I tried selling my shit at a pawn shop. The guy said, you can't sell a dead goldfish, buddy! How about that? So I offered him my mother's gold tooth. He said, I thought your mother is alive? See, I pried it outta her mouth last month during her hysterotomy. She got her tubes tied, even though she's elderly, because one day I came around asking for money and she wouldn't lend me any, even if it meant I'd lose my house, even with a gun in her face. She said she wished I'd never been born and got 'em tied up anyway!

hey, why’s everybody laughin’ here? ain’t you supposed to be pumping my stomach? doc, you gonna ever pull these wires outta me? i feel like a car battery in this thing. i mean, i’ve got more cords here than a rock band, i tell ya. i mean, i’d love to sign these liability wavers, i tell ya, but my wife’s the power of attorney. how you think she got the house int he divorce? hey doc, ain't you gonna operate on me? you ain't fuckin' my wife now too, ain't ya? 

you guys have been great. i’m gonna go into a coma now.
