My wife, I tell ya. She and I never have sex. I told her I wanna do foreplay. She said, you're lucky to be getting one-play!

I get no respect. Like that song, R-E-S-P-E-C-T. You ever notice how it sounds like there’s no E? Just R-E-S-P-C-T? That’s the kind of respect I get. I tell ya.

My wife, she’s no looker. You couldn't sell her if you tried, and I tried! They wouldn't take her in Myanmar. They said, try the fourth world, pal.

I tell ya, I’m not finding much respect these days. I asked my neighbor, "You seen my wife today?" He said, "Not really, I was wearing a blindfold the whole time!"

I ain’t no prize neither. I went to a bachelor auction and I wound up having to pay a girl to date me! So ya know, just another Friday night. 

I haven’t gotten much action lately. Even my dog won’t kiss me. I said, listen pal, half the time you're licking your balls; you sayin’ mine ain’t good enough for ya? Anybody? Anybody?

My wife—listen to this—she hates my guts, probably because of the prostitutes and that I tried to sell her to a warlord. She hates me so much she poisoned me with a toxin found in goldfish. It’s bad enough she tried to kill me, but she gotta off my aquarium too? 

I tell ya, I don’t get no respect, not from my wife, my dog, my neighbor, this audience—nobody. Sometimes, at night, I sit by the phone with a fast-action single-pump revolver and think, "The next one of youse to call is getting this bullet." Lucky for them, nobody ever calls!

Oh boy, is it tough being a comedian. I'm constantly broke. My wife left me for my neighbor. I'm not getting any respect. So I tried selling my mother's gold tooth at a pawn shop. See, I pried it outta her during her last month. She got her tubes tied, even though she's elderly, ‘cause one day I came around asking for money and she wouldn't lend me none, even if it meant I'd lose my house, even with a gun in her face. Told me she wished I'd never been born and got 'em tied anyway!

Once, in the dead of night, I took a taxi up the pacific coast highway headed anywhere but here. Along the way I cracked a joke, “How’s my passenger-ing?” but this fella didn’t flinch. Absolutely no respect. Maybe it was the booze or his look of cold indifference, but boy did it tick me off. Well, there's this stretch where emptiness is illuminated endlessly in all directions solely by moonlight. That sumbitch never saw it coming, my gun, pressed nice and tight into his jugular. I screamed, "Cat got your tongue, pal? You shtuppin’ my wife too?” Then there was nothing but metal and glass and blood—no driver or trail leading to a lifeless retch—just me in the backseat, as if the car flipped itself. For months, I fruitlessly pored over newspapers, obits, and police scanners and searched for a sign it was real—whether lil' Felipe, his legless, infant son awoke that next day fatherless. 

But hey, I’d rather ride take that ride again than let my wife drive!

Why’s everybody laughing here? Doc, ain’t you supposed to be pumping my stomach? Oh boy, this goldfish business is no joke. Why there gotta be so many wires in me, doc? I feel like a car battery. I mean, I've got more cords here than a rock band, I tell ya. Listen, I’d love to sign these liability wavers, but my wife’s the power of attorney. How you think she got the house in the divorce? 

you guys have been great. i’m gonna go into a coma now.
