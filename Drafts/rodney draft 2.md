My wife, I tell ya. She and I never have sex. The other day I wanted to do foreplay. She said, you're lucky to be getting one-play!

I get no respect. Like that song, R-E-S-P-E-C-T. You ever notice how it sounds like there’s no E? Just R-E-S-P-C-T? That’s the kind of respect I get. I tell ya.

My wife's a terrible driver. She can't keep her eyes on the road. I told her to pretend it was any man but me, and she threatened to drive us off a cliff. How 'bout that? The first promise I thought she might actually keep!

I got no sex life. Even my dog won’t kiss me. Half the time he's licking his balls, but I guess mine ain't good enough for him! Anybody?

I’m not finding much respect these days. I asked my neighbor, "You seen my wife?" He replied, "Not really, I was wearing a blindfold the whole time!"

She’s no looker, my wife. You couldn't sell her if you tried, and I tried! They wouldn't take her in Myanmar. They said, try the fourth world, pal.

But I ain’t no prize neither. I went to a bachelor auction and wound up having to pay a girl to date me. So ya know, just another Friday night. 

My wife—listen to this—she hates me, probably 'cause of all the prostitutes and my trying to sell her to a warlord. She hates my guts so much, she poisoned me with a toxin found only in goldfish. It’s bad enough she tried to kill me, but she gotta off my aquarium too? 

I tell ya, I don’t get no respect, not from my wife, my dog, my neighbor—nobody. Sometimes at night, I sit by the phone with a single-action revolver and think, "The next one of youse to call is getting this bullet." Lucky for them, nobody ever calls!

Boy, is it tough being a comedian. I'm constantly broke. My wife's banging my neighbor. I'm not getting any respect. So I pawned my mother's gold tooth. See, I pried it outta her mouth last month. She got her tubes tied, ‘cause I came around asking for money and she wouldn't lend me none, even if it meant I'd lose my house, even with a gun in her face. Told me she wished I'd never been born and got 'em tied at eighty-five, just in case!

Listen to this doozy. Once, in the dead of night, I took a taxi up the pacific coast highway headed anywhere but home. There's this stretch where emptiness is illuminated endlessly by lonely moonlight. I cracked a joke, “How’s my passenger-ing?” but this fella didn’t flinch. Maybe it was the booze or his indifferent mug, but boy did that contemptible disrespect tick me off. The sumbitch never saw it coming, my gun, pressed nice and tight into his jugular. I screamed, "Cat got your tongue, pal? You shtuppin’ my wife too?” Then there was nothing but metal and glass and blood—no driver, no trail leading to a lifeless retch—just me in the backseat, as if the car flipped itself. For months, I pored over newspapers and obits and police scanners, but never found out if lil' Felipe, his infant son, awoke the next day fatherless, or if it was all a dream. 

But hey, I’d rather take that trip again than let my wife drive!

Woah, what's everyone laughing at? Doc, ain’t you supposed to be pumping my stomach? This goldfish business is no joke. I feel like a car battery with all these wires in me. I got more cords than a rock band, I tell ya. Listen, I’d love to sign these liability wavers, but my wife’s the power of attorney. How you think she got the house in the divorce? 

You guys have been great. I’m gonna go into a coma now.
