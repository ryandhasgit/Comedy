My wife, I tell ya. She and I never have sex. The other day I wanted to do foreplay. She said, you're lucky to be getting one-play!

I get no respect. Like that song, R-E-S-P-E-C-T. You ever notice how it sounds like there’s no E? Just R-E-S-P-C-T? That’s the kind of respect I get. I tell ya.

My wife's a terrible driver. She can't keep her eyes on the road. I told her to pretend it's any man but me, and she threatened to drive us off a cliff. How 'bout that? The first promise I thought she'd actually keep!

I got no sex life. Even my dog won’t kiss me. He's always licking his balls, but I guess mine ain't good enough for him. Anybody? Anybody?

I’m not finding much respect these days. I asked my neighbor if he’d seen my wife. He replied, "Not really, I was blindfolded the whole time!" 

She’s no looker, my wife. You couldn't sell her if you tried, and I tried! They wouldn't take her in Myanmar. They said, try the fourth world, pal. 

But I ain’t no prize neither. I went to a bachelor auction and wound up having to pay a girl to date me. So ya know, just another Friday night. 

My wife—listen to this—she hates me, probably 'cause of all the prostitutes and my trying to sell her to a Burmese warlord. She hates my guts so much, she poisoned me with a toxin found only in goldfish. It’s bad enough she tried to kill me, but she gotta off my aquarium too? 

I tell ya, I don’t get no respect, not from my wife, my dog, my neighbor—nobody. At night I sit by the phone with a single-action revolver and think, "The next one of youse to call is getting this bullet." Lucky for them, nobody ever calls!

Things are tough. I'm constantly broke. My wife's banging my neighbor. I'm not getting no respect. So I pawned my mother's gold tooth that I stole outta her mouth while she was getting her tubes tied. She did it cause I was begging for money and she wouldn't lend me none, even if it meant losing my house, even with a gun in her face. She didn't want another one of me, so at eighty-five she got 'em tied, just in case!

Listen to this. Once, in the dead of night, I took a taxi up the pacific coast highway and told the driver to run the meter 'til the wheels fall off. There's this stretch where emptiness is illuminated endlessly by lonesome moonlight. I joked, “How’s my passenger-ing?” but this fella didn’t flinch. Maybe it was the booze or his ugly mug, but boy did I get no respect from that. The sumbitch never saw it coming, my gun, pressed into his neck. I screamed, "Cat got your tongue, pal? I bet you're shtuppin’ my wife too, ain't ya?” Then there was nothing but metal and glass and blood—no driver, no sullied trail of guts—just me in the backseat, like the car flipped itself. I pored over newspapers and obits and police scanners, but never found out if lil' Felipe, his infant son, awoke the next day fatherless or if it was all a dream. 

Still, better than letting my wife drive!

But this goldfish business is no joke. I might go belly up myself. Whatcha laughing for, Doc? I'm serious. Ain't you supposed to be pumping my stomach, anyway? I feel like a car battery with all these wires in me. I tell ya, I got more cords than a rock band. But I guess I'm a lucky, 'cause at the end I can ask Death, "What took ya so long?" He was probably banging my wife! 

You guys have been great, but I've got a coma to get to!
