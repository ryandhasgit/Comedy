top levels, mine: remove dog joke maybe, and where he's listing people, just add others in there that we didn' talk tabout? having everyone in there might not be strong ehough to jutify so much being wrtapped into one joke

scott didn't mentioend length as aproblem, so maybe i'll keep that

My wife's a terrible driver. She can't keep her eyes on the road. I told her to pretend it's any man but me, and she threatened to boil my head. The first promise I thought she'd actually keep!

My wife, lemme tell ya. She never wants to have sex. Hell, even dog won't kiss me and he's always licking his balls. But I guess main ain't good enough. Anybody? Anybody?

My wife, I tell ya. She and I never have sex. I asked her, "Wanna move this to the bed?" She goes, "Only if it's your deathbed, you whoring S.O.B." 

It's tough these days I asked my neighbor if he’d seen my wife. He replied, "Not really, I was blindfolded the whole time!" 

Boy, do I get no respect, so I bought myself a gun. The guy joked, "Promise not to off anyone important, will ya?" I told 'em, "Don't worry pal, just my wife!" 
The guy, he cracked a joke, made me promise not to off anyone important.

She’s no looker, my wife. You couldn't sell her if you tried, and I tried! They wouldn't take her in Myanmar. They said, try the fourth world, pal. I tell ya.

My wife—listen to this—she hates me, probably 'cause of all the whores and my trying to sell her to a Burmese drug lord. So she poisoned me with a toxin found only in goldfish. It’s bad enough she tried to kill me, but she gotta off my aquarium too? 

I tell ya, I don’t get no respect, not from my wife, my dog, my neighbor—nobody. At night I sit by the phone with this single-action revolver and think, "The next one of youse to call is getting this bullet." Lucky for them, nobody ever calls!


Things are tough. I'm constantly broke. My wife's banging my neighbor. I'm not getting no respect. So I pawned my mother's gold tooth that I stole outta her mouth while she was getting her tubes tied. She did it cause I was begging for money and she wouldn't lend me none, even if it meant losing my house, even with a gun in her face. She didn't want another one of me, so at eighty-five she got 'em tied, just in case!

Listen to this. Once, in the dead of night, I took a taxi up the pacific coast highway and told the driver to run the meter 'til the wheels fall off. There's this stretch where emptiness is illuminated endlessly by lonesome moonlight. I joked, “How’s my passenger-ing?” but this fella didn’t flinch. Maybe it was the booze or his ugly mug, but boy did I get no respect from that. The sumbitch never saw it coming, my gun, pressed into his neck. I screamed, "Cat got your tongue, pal? I bet you're shtuppin’ my wife too, ain't ya?” Then there was nothing but metal and glass and blood—no driver, no sullied trail of guts—just me in the backseat, like the car flipped itself. I pored over newspapers and obits and police scanners, but never found out if lil' Felipe, his infant son, awoke the next day fatherless or if it was all a dream. 

Still, better than letting my wife drive!

But this goldfish business is no joke. I might go belly up myself. Whatcha laughing for, Doc? I'm serious. Ain't you supposed to be pumping my stomach, anyway? I feel like a car battery with all these wires in me. I tell ya, I got more cords than a rock band. But I guess I'm a lucky, 'cause at the end I can ask Death, "What took ya so long?" He was probably banging my wife! 

You guys have been great, but I've got a coma to get to!
